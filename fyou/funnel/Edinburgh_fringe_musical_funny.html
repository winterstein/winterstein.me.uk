                Deborah Orr: If this registrar had 'Christian views', why did she ever take on the job?
			 More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>The creepy and kooky comedy antics of Kirsten Schaal showed inspired flashes at a recent run in London, supporting the Arrested Development star David Cross. An hour of her subtle lunacy promises much more. More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>It is a performance which demands admiration - excellent actors, brilliant 
          masks, clever staging - but at the end I felt I had been watching a 
          beautifully presented history lesson, but one which did not engage my 
          feelings at all. Worth seeing, though, for its sheer theatricality. More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>I have seen the big popular hit of the 2001 Fringe, and it's Hamlet the Musical!  For the first time this Fringe I have sat in an audience that positively buzzed from the off, that spontaneously surged to its feet at the end. More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>The play tells, through flashback, the story of Lambert Simnel, pretender to the throne of England: how he was manipulated, defeated, and finally spared and set to work in the royal kitchens, which is where the action of the play takes place. More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>And justifiably so. I confess I had spotted this show as the obvious 
          turkey of the year. I mean, Hamet... the Musical??? Having 
          seen an absolutely disastrous <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>musical</a> version of Macbeth 
          back in '97, I was sharpening my pen to produce a devastating tirade 
          of witticisms at the expense of a ridiculous concept. The review was 
          half-written in my head before the show even started! More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>

		 More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>Kristen Schaal is, apparently, quite a famous alternative comedian in the States. This is her first year on the Fringe and last night the rather intimate venue she&#039;s appearing in was about half-full. Which is a shame, because she deserves more attention. Her comedy is largely based on the persona she creates, of a naively enthusiastic innocent. She does this very well, and I believe she is probably as fine an actress as she is a comedian. This is not &quot;laugh-a-minute&quot; comedy, but if you stick with it there will be enough amusing anecdotes to make it more than worthwhile. It&#039;s not going to suit everyone, but for something slightly slower-paced (though no less clever for it), Kristen Schaal is ideal.

I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d cope if I did, but I actually think he&rsquo;s rather grand. But he can go do one if he thinks I&rsquo;m spending that much money to hear him blether on for an hour and a half show freezing my tits off up in the high plastic-moulded event seats teetering on the edge of the volcanic crag-and-tail rock face of the strategically positioned <a href='http://fyouthe<a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>musical</a>.com/'>Edinburgh</a> Castle as he paints his face in mock&nbsp;woad, goads Scots and then goes on about how much money and international fame he has. Also it'll be ready for DVD quicker than you can say &lsquo;flogging it around the time of airing the last episodes of Extras for the Christmas market&rsquo;. Leave it out. Its obscene.&nbsp; &pound;300,000 for the sell-out 8000 seater venue.&nbsp; OK that's possibly a stressy prospect, but then so is running around getting loans, remortgaging homes etc&nbsp;in the hope that you'll even break even the &pound;20 grand it could cost artistes performing every day throughout the whole of the festival. Especially when there are&nbsp;such numbers and diversity of shows and creative talent from around the globe hanging about the Royal Mile trying to not get caught up with crowds of people festooned with tam o'shanters, tartan gonks and shortbread. There are so many diverting, intelligent, engaging, creative works going on that my magpie-like sensibilities have been on overdrive these past few days. I'm sure his show will be fab. I just think there is more comedy to be had than spending that much money for 90 minutes of one person. So, the challenge is set: See and review as many shows as I can for &pound;37.50 and when the price is hit, blag my way into shows or accept freebies (Gervais, if you're feeling generous ..). The tactic this week: to get a head and see as many previews as possible. More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>Jon Richardson is definitely one to watch. BBC6Music radio listeners will already be aware of his razor-sharp wit, askew anecdotes and obsessive attentions to particular details of everyday life that lesser comedians would bypass: the geographical distribution of Dyson Airblades (not any old bog-standard or standard bog hand-dryer), and extolling the virtues of Mr Moustache(less) football pundit king Mark Lawrenson. Richardson&rsquo;s show, Spatula Pad will also serve as a launch pad. He is fab. Go, see, laugh and laugh some more. Part kitchen utensil draw, part reflections on living on his own, Jon Richardson&rsquo;s first solo <a href='http://fyouthe<a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>musical</a>.com/'>Edinburgh</a> show is more than simply the public confessions of self-confessed obsessive compulsive. His stand up manner is easy and engaging which draws audience members into his witty takes on the world and how things could be made better; and the show is packed with laugh-out-loud ruminations about the minutiae of manners, matters and material objects that people would otherwise callously ignore. This is where he comes into his own. I like him all the more for his attentiveness to such things because I feel I am not the only person similarly afflicted. Kitchen technologies rarely get a mention in comedy. Not so with the Richardson. Pickled-onion technologies, fried-egg frames shaped as body parts are just some that get a look in as he meditates on life more generally. His ad-libbing and general banter with audience members is both affectionate and cuttingly <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>funny</a> at the same time. You will come out with your face aching from laughter, and you will never use a pencil or eat a sandwich again without thinking about him.Get down the Hut at the Pleasance and laugh yourself silly &hellip;.Joanna Neary&rsquo;s Little Moments.Pleasance Cellar16:45 &ndash; 1745Until August 26th More info here: <a href=''>Edinburgh fringe musical funny</a>.</p><p>Still to come ..
