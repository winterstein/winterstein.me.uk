<p>Showing at The Roxy Art House 29th July - 25th August
Kiddy-Fiddler on the Roof is a <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>musical</a> satire on tabloid hysteria and the media�s reaction to the threat of paedophilia.
Townsville Comprehensive is an ailing school like any other - until the day Peter falsely accuses his teacher, Arnold Finkler, of molesting him. Rumour quickly spreads and the town�s parents go wild. Stirred up by Jean McDonald, local agony aunt and Townsville�s undisputed moral matriarch, the parents rally together, ready to do whatever it takes to clean up the neighbourhood. Spurred on by Jean�s inflammatory column in the Townsville Herald, the parents march on the innocent Arnold �
But will the truth prevail?
Moral outrage, betrayal, sex and secrets meet love, truth and friendship for the ultimate showdown - all through the medium of song!

The show is a satire on tabloid hysteria and the media's reaction to the threat of paedophilia. It went down a storm when it was first performed at the Moser Theatre, Oxford, in 2007-and is all set to do the same at this year's Fringe!

Musicians will need to be available at the end of July and all of August. Whilst no previous experience of playing in a show band is required, performers must be adept at picking up music quickly.

They perform totally unscripted shows based on audience suggestions: imagine a live 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'.

Sheffield <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>comedy</a> legend Toby Foster has described the group as "the future of improvised <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>comedy</a>", and they'll be taking to the <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>Edinburgh</a> Fringe Festival stage in August this year.

This show, in the Raynor Lounge in the Students Union, is the Shrimps last before <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>Edinburgh</a>, and they'll be joined for one night only by <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>musical</a> <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>comedy</a> duo The Rasputins.

This will be a supremely entertaining evening and is something a bit different to conventional stand-up. 


The audience calls the shots, so anything can happen!

The show is taking place as part of the Unions's graduation week events programme but is open to students and non-students alike.  In fact a diverse audience makes for an even more exciting show!

Can't it stay that way? More info here: <a href=''>musical comedy Edinburgh</a>.</p><p>I know I mentioned them on a previous blog but since then the 5th of their random ass radio show came out since then and its reinforced the need to let y'all know. Silence in C Minor. Its kinda absurdist, I guess its like what the Boosh did before hitting it big, similar to their madness. I'm only there at the end of the month but they're up with a stage show throughout the fringe fest so worth a watch me thinks. More info here: <a href=''>musical comedy Edinburgh</a>.</p><p>Comedy-wise, two of my all-time favourite <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>Edinburgh</a> discoveries are in town. Hans Teeuwen, who debuted spectacularly last year and went on to West End success, is back, in rotation with the lesser Dutch comic Micha Wertheim. Alas, the great Doug Stanhope is performing only once, to an audience of one, at a cost of over £7,000 (so it ain't going to be me...) in what sounds like the most confused protest so far against the launch of the <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>Edinburgh</a> Comedy Festival brand.

However, he risks all with gags and throwaway lines designed to push the envelope. Behind this approach lurks a genuine belief that he should be allowed to say whatever he likes whenever he likes. A particular bugbear with him currently is the ire he causes with certain women audience-members with jokes about cavernous female genitalia.

Once, stand-up <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>comedy</a> was a mere sideshow at the fringe. Now it has snatched centre stage with a diversity and range of quality unparalleled in the world.

In 2002, his <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>Edinburgh</a> Fringe Festival show Things I Like I Lick was nominated for the Perrier Award and in 2006 he won the if.comeddie, successor to the Perrier Award, with a show entitled The Naked Racist which he has performed at The Stand <a href='http://fyouthemusical.com/'>comedy</a> club and later at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
