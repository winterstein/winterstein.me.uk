<h1>The Heist of the Art</h1>
<p>This page contains links to supporting documentation for 
<a href="http://www.winterstein.me.uk">Daniel Winterstein's</a> Heist of the Art project.
Since the project is driven by action and narrative, and I am a writer, this documentation is mostly textual rather than visual.
</p>
<h1>Writing</h1>
I have written a number of plays, short stories and newspaper articles.
Here are some examples of my work:
<p>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>
JOHN: It's a tough business. Not everyone can take it.<br>
BENWAY: This is true. Especially with this kind of money at stake.<br>
JOHN: I can feel it pushing down on me now.<br>
BENWAY: Can you take the pressure?<br>
JOHN: Does the pope shit in the woods?</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; <a href="http://winterstein.me.uk/writing/campaign.print.html">Show me the Money</a> (first performed at The Traverse, Edinburgh)<br>
<i>"superb... great characterisation, sparkling dialogue and solid structure"</i> &mdash; Edinburgh Evening News
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>
Things to remember: Except for going to bed, everything you do after 3am will be wrong. 
<!--
It's that time of day when morning is spelt with a 'u' and sunlight 
just gives you skin cancer and the only good your last lecture did was practice 
your ability to take notes you don't understand for when you become a secretary and 
you can't see any future for yourself and you don't know how you'll make it through 
the morning to the future you can't see yourself having and your girl is hundreds 
of miles away and there're only bills in the mail and you're actively hoping for 
armageddon because that'd get you out of the next lecture and your sentences are 
just rambling messes that you have to remember not to grumble.
-->

<p><i>Perhaps it was all the drugs he'd taken as a student, but at the age of 
34, Max Lipowicz's liver became conscious. Like all sentient beings, it desired 
companionship. Unfortunately its attempts to communicate were variously misinterpreted 
by Max as hangovers, indigestion and an allergic reaction to shrimp. In frustration, 
the liver developed telepathy. "Hello," Max thought, "I'm hearing voices." and 
wondered if this was due to all the drugs he'd taken as a student.<br>
"Just one voice." his liver corrected, and explained who it was.
Max, of course, headed straight for the nearest doctor.</i><br />

<blockquote>
<p><i>There was a village, a little bit like this one. In fact not so much like this one, 
because here it is big and smelly and full of too many people and noise and cars and animals 
and buildings and trains and pushing and buses and shoving and queueing and shopping and 
bustling and tooting and running and... in fact some people would say that this here is not a 
village at all. And here it seems that there is not enough time to just sit and watch a 
feather fall from the sky. Simple and soft, on the breath of the wind. And how sad it makes 
me that here people do not spend the time they have on finding the holes made by rainbows 
or catching falling stars in nets at night or bottling birdsong to bake into cakes.</i><br/>
