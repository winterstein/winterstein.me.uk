<title>Logic-Engine.cl - a Prolog-style system for Lisp</title>
<body>


This is a Prolog style inference system (i.e. a horn clause logic prover) written in Common Lisp. If you are familiar with Prolog, it should be simple to use - you just have to learn a new lisp-flavoured syntax. The top of the code contains documentation on how to use it.
