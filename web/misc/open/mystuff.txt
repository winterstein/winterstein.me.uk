In his honour, the Division of Informatics organised a conference this week of Alan's alumni and fans. Here are my rambling notes...\r
                                                                                               : \r

Fausto argued that strong/general AI had failed whereas weak/narrow AI was a success. Others felt that weak/narrow AI was the best route to strong/general AI, and so there was no failure, merely a steady advance.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : The general consensus was that AI is in rude health. It has gone from a quirky academic subject to being a multi-billion industry, powering many sectors - such as search (e.g. Google), eLearning, medical imaging... As several people observed/complained, when an AI technology starts working, people no longer call it AI - it becomes computer science.\r
                                                                                               : \r

AIs will not be human like (to quote Marvin Minsky "the first AI will be crazy."), and there will not even be a clear boundary between the AI and the world. We humans think in terms of inside (the brain, the machine) versus outside (the world), but this is not the case for modern computer systems, where much of the intelligence may reside in the environment.\r

New lecturing tools are going to transform the humble blackboard. For example, with handwriting recognition for formulae, which can then be plotted on the blackboard. In medicine, there is work on projecting a 3D model of a beating heart onto the blackboard, which the lecturer can then open up with their hands. Incredible stuff.\r
                                                                                               : \r

Diversity is not a defect to be absorbed by design, but a feature to be maintained, encouraged and exploited through run-time adaptation.\r
                                                                                               : \r

He came to Britain from Germany not believing that machines could do calculations but not real mathematical reasoning. He was shown a theorem prover, and was converted on the spot. He wired his fiance and family in Berlin to say "This is too deep. I'm staying in Sussex." and never looked back.\r

For a start you'll need some form of web-application server. E.g. you might use TomCat. FaceBook web-applications have a slightly strange usage pattern. Most of your pages will be served through FaceBook. The user will request a page from FaceBook, who will then request it's main contents from your server. Your contents will be adapted before being sent back to the user. Mostly you don't need to worry about this - it works nicely. But be aware that JavaScript is not allowed That means if you're using an AJAX platform, it won't work within FaceBook. If you need AJAX - and FaceBook's mock-ajax won't do - then use your FaceBook pages to direct users off of FaceBook onto normal web-pages.\r

This will no longer work - you'll get an exception.\r

This overrides whatever default profile-page content you specified in the application settings. When you set a user's profile FBML FaceBook will cache this content. It does not ask you for updates when the profile is viewed. This makes dynamic profile content a bit fiddlier than it would otherwise be. You'll need to update the affected profiles with fresh calls to profilesetFBML() in response to events. Fortunately, although you need a logged in client to do anything, that client can set profile content for any of your users.\r

Michael Atiyah is one of the world's most eminent mathematicians. His work has been influential on modern theoretical physics. He used his leaving speech at the RSE to pose deep questions: What is reality? Is the universe built using the "fantastically intricate mathematics" of String Theory? Or do we await a new Newton or Einstein to simplify the picture?\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : Although 79, Sir Michael Atiyah remains full of energy. Born in England to a Lebanese father and Scottish mother, he now lives in Scotland where he holds an honorary professorship at the University of Edinburgh. Atiyah made profound connections between research in advanced geometry and the physics of Quantum Mechanics. He is a mathematician rather than a physicist, but has worked closely with leading physicists in Quantum Mechanics and String Theory. He has received numerous awards and honours, including the Fields Medal in 1966 - the mathematics equivalent of a Nobel prize - a knighthood in 1986 and the prestigious Order of Merit in 1992.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : The main issue in modern physics is how to resolve two conflicting theories: the Standard Model of Quantum Mechanics, and Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Quantum Mechanics describes the very small - an exotic zoo of sub-atomic particles. These can be in several states at once, leading to the strange quandary of Schrodinger's cat who is both alive and dead at the same time. Meanwhile, General Relativity describes the very big - with the force of gravity acting as a distortion of time and space. Both theories have been thoroughly tested in experiments, but attempts to combine them are problematic. This has set physicists since Einstein searching for the elusive "Theory of Everything", a theory which will explain both Quantum Mechanics and Relativity as two views of one underlying truth. String Theory is the best candidate for that.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : String Theory considers all particles to be made up of tiny vibrating strings. The length and vibrations of these strings determine their behaviour, like notes interacting in a guitar chord. Bizarrely, the theory suggests that space has more dimensions than we commonly observe. We are aware of 3 dimensions of space, and time is counted as the fourth dimension. But attempts to apply String Theory in 4 dimensions lead to problems. So if String Theory is correct, there are other dimensions that must be invisible to us. Scientists believe the extra dimensions exist as tiny subatomic tubes.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : The problem with String Theory is that it is not one clean theory, but a family of possible theories. There are no experiments to test which of these are correct - if any. The new giant collider at CERN may find evidence that lends weight to String Theory, but it is not expected to settle the question. However progress is being made. Led by American professor Edward Witten, physicists and mathematicians are discovering that what they thought were completely different theories, are in fact different ways of looking at the same theory.\r
                                                                                               : \r

As an example, consider a simple stone. We see a stone as a lump of solid rock. To a chemist, it is a collection of atoms. To a physicist, those atoms are mostly empty space criss-crossed by force-fields. To a mathematician, those fields are a set of equations. Perhaps, Sir Michael suggested, the equations are the true reality.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : Though he helped develop modern theories, Atiyah does not believe they are the final answer. We may be making the same mistake as the ancient Greeks, who thought the planets moved in circles. Since this did not match observations, the Greek astronomoer Ptolemy added extra circles rolling on the first circles (epicycles), and then extra circles again were added - wheels within wheels. The result explained the experimental data of the time, but it was overly complicated - and wrong.

But there's a key difference. "In a computer game or a TV show, you visit another world. In a pervasive game, another world comes to you!" says Winterstein who like Halliwell holds a PhD degree from the University of Edinburgh. "New technology allows us to take the real world as the arena. Our characters will have Facebook pages, they'll text and email players - even meet with some of them." The result is to bring a drama or advertising campaign very much to life.\r

"Time costs and scalability are key problems, and that's where software can help," explains Halliwell. "Our systems will understand plot devices and characters. And they'll take the drudgery out of talking with players across different media platforms. Scotland is a world leader in video games. We believe it can become an international center for pervasive gaming too."\r

 What does Britain do for money? UK exports 2007                                               | <img src='http://www.platypusinnovation.com/asset?assetId=2743'>\r
                                                                                               : \r

In the face of massive losses it behoves us to ask, how does Britain make money? I.e. if you viewed Britain as a business, where does its revenue come from? This is a big question, and I can only present a brief answer here - an overview of British exports.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : It is easier to find charts of GDP. But GDP combines actual income with internal sales, so it reveals what the British do for money, but not what the UK itself does for money.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : This chart shows gross UK exports of both goods and services, plus net income from investments - that is, it shows everything that leads to money entering the UK. It is based on 2007 figures from the National Office of Statistics, published in the 2008 "Pink Book". It doesn't consider imported inputs, which has the effect of inflating the apparent size of some sectors.\r
                                                                                               : \r
                                                                                               : Overall we sell more goods than services. That said, we import a lot more goods than we export - we have a modest trade surplus in services, and a worrying trade deficit in goods (not shown here - see the Pink Book for details).\r
                                                                                               : \r

The UK's manufacturing sector has certainly shrunk dramatically over the last decade/century, but it still constitutes the largest sector of the country's income. (Note that the importance of manufacturing will have been inflated somewhat here by the lack of input-output analysis.).\r

The chemical industry doesn't receive as much press attention as manufacturing or finance - perhaps because it isn't going down the toilet except when intended.\r

 Java: A new approach to Equals()                                                              | Custom equals() methods are handy but involve writing a lot of ugly boilerplate code - and there are booby-traps for the unwary. In this post, I present a way of over-riding equals() and hashCode() methods - based on annotations - which makes them a doddle to implement and maintain. The resulting code is available open-source on request in a shrink-wrapped jar.\r

You must also override `hashcode()` in an equivalent manner. Otherwise HashSet, HashMap and HashTable will exhibit strange bugs.

I did some time trials, and the annotations based method came out as 3x slower. That's fine during development and if `equals()` / `hashCode()` are not bottlenecks. Note that `equals()` and `hashCode()` can be bottlenecks, e.g. when making intensive use of Maps. So you may not want to use this in some production systems.\r

The film follows a pair of bickering peasants - fugitives from the losing side in a war - who get caught up in rescuing a feisty princess. Akira Kurosawa is a legendary Japanese director, perhaps better known in the west for his influence on our directors. George Lucas was one of his fans, and helped fund one of Kurosawa's later films. He also used Hidden Fortress as the model for Star Wars.\r

As well as the idea of telling the story from the points of view of the film's lowliest characters (Tahei and Matakishi / R2D2 and C3P0), Lucas also copied some of the aesthetics and a couple of scenes. For someone raised on Star Wars, it is somehow uncanny to see elements of it appearing in an old black-and-white movie - in some cases, copied right down to the scene-wipes and sound-effects.\r
                                                                                               : \r

Star Wars is in no way a remake of Hidden Fortress. The plots are radically different. George Lucas also stole from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey theory. It is Campbell's theory that gives us the hero, the mentor, and the "dark father" who the hero must face. From the dark father stemmed the character of Darth Vader, one of film's most memorable villains. Though Vader's costume was inspired by Samurai armour, his role is from Joseph Campbell - Darth Vader is literally a corruption of dark father via Dutch.\r
                                                                                               : \r

Although not that alone - plenty of films since have copied the structure without the greatness. Excellent acting, script and special effects also play their part.\r
                                                                                               : \r

It's still a great film though, with hints of deeper themes. Morally grey areas and darker notes show through Kurosawa's black and white cinematography. Even though this is an action/adventure flick, he shows "people as they really are." (to quote Princess Yuki), "their beauty and their ugliness".\r
