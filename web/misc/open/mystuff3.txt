 How to add an image to a blog post | You include images using html. E.g.
                                    : 
                                    : <code><img src="myImage.jpg" align="right"></code>
                                    : 
                                    : If the image has a stable url somewhere else then you can hot-link to it. 
                                    : Otherwise you should upload a copy as follows:
                                    : 
                                    : 1. Go to [assets](/assetManager)
                                    : 2. Upload the image you want to use. *PLEASE RESIZE IT FIRST!* 
                                    : You are allowed to upload up to 10mb, which would be a bad idea!
                                    : 3. Now go to the text editor for your blog post. You should see a thumbnail of your image at the bottom of the page.
                                    :  4. Drag and drop your image into the text editor. That will insert the source url, but not an image
                                    : tag. You need to convert the url into an `img` tag, adding width, height and other settings if you like.
                                    : It's good practice to add alt and title attributes (alt is for blind people and whilst the image loads, 
                                    : title is shown on mouseover - usually they should be the same). E.g. convert
                                    : 
                                    : `http://everyoneisplaying.com/static/uploads/1/0073555delmee__p8882863010604442581.jpg`

                                    : Hm: a bit painful that - even worse than Wordpress's image upload. Hopefully you can live with it for now - we'd prefer to focus on improving outward-facing functionality. Let me know if it gets annoying.
