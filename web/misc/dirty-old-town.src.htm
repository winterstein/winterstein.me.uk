D  E   G  B
I met my love
G  A B  G      D
By the gasworks wall
G   B   D   E
Dreamed a dream
B  d e d    b
By the old canal
d  e   d     B
I kissed my love
G  A   B  G    D
By the factory wall
E  G   B   A
Dirty old town
B   G   A   E
Dirty old town


Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

I'm going to make me a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town
Dirty old town

I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed a girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town
Dirty old town
