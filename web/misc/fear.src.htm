<title>Litany against fear</title>
<body>
<div id="litany">
    I will not fear. <br>
    Fear is the mind-killer. <br>
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br>
    I will face my fear. <br>
    I will let it pass over me and through me. <br>
    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br>
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. <br>
    Only I will remain.
