You see a lift. It goes up, way up high.<br/>
As you rise you feel your weight dropping away.<br/>
The lift doors open and you are on the moon.<br/>
You step out of the lift, one long slow step.<br/>
The moon is silent. You are surrounded by calm.<br/>
You look down at the Earth.<br/>
You can still hear the meeting through the radio. It sounds tinny but clear.<br/>
You can see the room you came from.<br/>
It's far away and very small.<br/>
