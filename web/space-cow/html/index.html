			<p>Cleo liked to watch the skies.</p>
			<p> 
			She liked to see the moon as it shrank (or <em>waned</em> as the 
			astronomers say) and grew 
			(or <em>waxed</em> as the astronomers say, though they don't say <em>who</em> waxed the moon, &amp;
			waxing other things like lemons &amp; cars does not make them grow).
			She liked to sit in the window and look at rainbows, when the rain drops slice the sunlight into many colours.
			Most of all she liked to spot shooting stars (<em>meteors</em>) which blaze across the night sky.
			Like this:   </p>


			<div class='StoryImage NightSky'>
				<div id='Meteor' onclick="doAnimateMeteor(this);">
					<img id='Meteor' class='NightSky StoryImage' src='../img/sky.jpg'>
					<img id="meteor" src="../img/meteor.png" class="Sprite" style="top:5px; left:-100px;">				
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Sometimes Cleo would see a meteor shower -- a whole group of meteors like this:</p>

			<div class='StoryImage NightSky'>
				<div class='btn NightSky' id='MeteorShower' onclick="doAnimateMeteor(this);">
					<img class='NightSky StoryImage' src='../img/sky.jpg'>
					<img id="meteorshower" src="../img/meteorshower.png" class="Sprite" style="top:5px; left:-100px;">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>One night she saw a special meteor that went like this:</p>

			<!-- <blockquote>
			  <p>-8-+</p>
			</blockquote>-->

			<div class='StoryImage NightSky'>
				<div id='MeteorSpecial' onclick="doAnimateMeteor(this);">
					<img class='NightSky StoryImage' src='../img/sky.jpg'>
					<img id="meteorspecial" src="../img/meteor.png" class="Sprite" style="top:5px; left:-100px;">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>So she went to get Joshi.</p>

			<p>
			Joshi had seen lots of meteors but they all flew straight. He'd never seen one before that looped the loop.
			It seemed to come down close by, over by the park near his house.</p>

			<p>So he pulled on his coat &amp; his boots &amp; went to investigate.</p>

			<p>He climbed up the hill &amp; saw the most incredible thing.
			There was a pale flying saucer, the size of a large car, which shimmered in the moonlight. It stood a metre off the ground on thick stubby metal legs.
			A door was open in it's side &amp; aramp led down to the ground.
			In front of the flying saucer &amp; the globe was a cow.</p>

			<p>But not like any cow Joshi had ever seen before.</p>

			<p>This cow was blue &amp; green. She was eating the grass (which is the normal for cows) 
			&amp; wearing several electronic gadgets &amp; singing to herself (which is not).</p>

			<div class="StoryImage center-block"><img src='../img/space_cow.png' class='StoryImage img-thumbnail'
				width="600" data-bottom-top="zoom:0.85;" data-center-center="zoom:1;">
			</div>

			<p>Joshi came closer &amp; this is what the cow sang:</p>

			<blockquote>
			  <p>The grass you grow here is lovely, <br />
			  Your meadows are a wonderful laugh, <br />
			  I wish I could stay &amp; chew the cud, <br />
			  But for me it's the starry path.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Then she stopped singing and chewed in silence for a minute. After which she spoke.</p>

			<p>&lt;&lt;Third planet. The grass has a rich taste with a summery tang.
			There are after-tastes of smoke and industrial flavours.>></p>

			<p>The cow suddenly left off talking, and stared straight at Joshi.   </p>

			<p>"Moo," said the cow, "moo moo." <br />
			Joshi asked "What kind of a cow are you? Who were you talking to just now about the grass?" <br />
			"Moo." repeated the cow. <br />
			"Cow's don't actually say 'moo', they just moo." said Joshi, "It's different." <br />
			"Blast." said the cow, "I can't get the accent right." <br />
			Then she smiled and said "Hello Earth Child. I am Space Cow, interstellar food critic, &amp; I travel the stars
			tasting the grass of different planets." <br />
			"I write a guide book you know. It's read by many grass-eaters across the Milky Way."   </p>

			<p>Joshi nodded thoughtfully. Adults often say things that make little sense. A thoughtful nod seems to please them. <br />
			"What is the big ball?" he asked.</p>

			<p>"That is my planet of course." the cow replied.
			"I get terribly homesick when I'm away from my planet, so I take it with me." <br />
			"Your planet is very small." Joshi observed. <br />
			The cow gave a reproachful moo and drew her feet together in a stand-offish manner.
			Joshi feared he had offended her.</p>

			<p>"It may be small," said the cow, "But I take very good care of it. Better care than you take of your planet."   </p>

			<p>Joshi did not want to offend Space Cow, so he hastily added "It does look lovely. Especially the river."</p>

			<p>Although the planet was no bigger than a normal house, it had a miniature river which ran through a lush grassy meadow
			("a continent, please" said Space Cow) down to the lake ("the sea" corrected Space Cow) that covered nearly half the planet.
			There was a small puff of water from the sea, and Joshi spotted a little whale, no bigger than a trout, that had just spouted. The
			whale rolled lazily over to look at Joshi, winked one tiny eye, and then dove beneath the water.</p>

			<p>"That is the Bonsai Whale." the cow explained, "I picked him up from the ocean ponds of Alpha Centauri."</p>

				data-bottom-top="width:400px;" data-center-center="width:600px;">
			</div>


			<p>The Bonsai Whale surfaced again. He sang in a deep rich voice:</p>

			<h2>Local Grass</h2>

			<p>"Hm" said Space Cow with a distant look in her eye, adding a thoughtful "Well." Then she chewed some grass. Finally she said
			"You must be a local."</p>

			<p>"Yes." said Joshi. He lived just round the corner which was about as local as you could get.   </p>

			<p>"Good." said Space Cow, "Then as a local of the planet, you can help me find the best grass on this planet."   </p>

			<p>"We'll travel in my spaceship." Space Cow continued, taking Joshi's agreement for granted. "Do your parents know where you are?"</p>

			<p>"No" said Joshi.</p>

			<p>So they went back to Joshi's house. Space Cow knocked on the door with one hoof. Joshi's mum answered the door. She looked at the alien cow in surprise.</p>

			<p>"I am Space Cow," said Space Cow, "And I am kidnapping your son for the evening."   </p>

			<p>Joshi's mum continued to look surprised.</p>

			<p>"There." Space Cow smiled, "Come along Joshi." and she trotted off to the spaceship.</p>


			<h2>The Spaceship</h2>

			<p>The spaceship was round and silver. Space Cow and Joshi trotted up the ramp. Inside there were no seats, but there was fresh hay
			on the floor, and a bale of hay which Joshi sat down on.</p>

			<p>The door closed. Space Cow mooed softly to herself and pushed a couple of buttons. 
			The spaceship rocked to the left, and it rocked to the right. Then it took off in a blaze of light. With a magnificent WHOOOSH! the spaceship
			flew up into the air. Up up high they went. Joshi could see the whole town spread out below them. The lights of town twinkled in the dusk.</p>

			<p>"Where has good grass on this planet?" Space Cow asked.</p>

			<p>Where had grass? Joshi thought. "The nursery garden" he said.</p>

			<p>"Computer." said Space Cow, "Take us to the nursery garden!"</p>

			<p>The spaceship dipped and flew down to earth. It hovered over the nursery. The silver legs came out and the spaceship touched down lightly
			on the football pitch. Space Cow's planet also landed with a soft thump.</p>

			<p>Space Cow and Joshi walked out onto the garden. It was evening &amp; there was no-one around. 
			Space Cow ate a patch of grass, mooing contentedly.</p>

			<p>"Not bad grass." said Space Cow, "Though it tastes a lot like the grass by your house."</p>

			<p>They went back into the spaceship. "Where next?" asked Space Cow.</p>

			<p>Where else had grass? Joshi thought. "My grandparent's garden." he said.</p>

			<p>"Computer." said Space Cow, "Take us to his grandparent's garden!"</p>

			<p>As they came down to land, Joshi said "Careful -- don't mess up Grandma's flower beds."</p>

			<p>Space Cow said the flowers looked delicious, but she would stay on the grass. She chewed a few mouthfuls thoughtfully.</p>

			<p>"Nice grass." said Space Cow as they went back into the spaceship, "Though it <em>also</em> tastes a lot like the grass by your house and the grass at the school."</p>

			<p>The noise of the spaceship disturbed Grandad, who had been doing a crossword puzzle. 
			He went to the window and drew the curtain -- just in time to see Space Cow trotting up the
			ramp into her spaceship.</p>

			<p>"Well!" said Grandad, "I've never seen an alien before. And in our garden!"</p>

			<p>"I hope it didn't mess up the pansies." said Grandma.</p>

			<h2>Alien Grass</h2>

			<p>"That was all nice grass, but it all tasted the same." said Space Cow.</p>

			<p>"It's grass. What else would grass taste like?" Joshi asked.</p>

			<p>"Oh, lots of things!" said Space Cow, "On my planet, we have plain grass, &amp; banana flavoured grass."</p>

			<p>"But let me show you a really interesting grass..."</p>

			<p>She pushed a lever. The spaceship rocked to the left, and it rocked to the right. Then it took off in a blaze of light. With a magnificent WHOOOSH! the spaceship
			flew up into the air. Up up high they went -- and they kept on going. Up, up into space. The whole planet lay below them like a beautiful marble.</p>

			</div>

			<p>"Where are we going?" Joshi asked.</p>

			<p>"To the Tau Ceti star," said Space Cow, "There's a planet there where they grow chocolate grass."</p>

			<p>Faster &amp; faster went the spaceship, and in a just a few minutes they had reached the planet of Tau Ceti Prime.</p>

			<p>They touched down at a very moden looking barn. A Tau Ceti cow came out to meet them. This cow was green &amp; orange. 
			"Moo!" said the Tau Ceti cow in a friendly way.</p>

			<p>Space Cow pointed at the grass around them. "This" she said, "is the famous chocolate grass of Tau-Ceti." She chewed a bit. "Delicious!" she said.</p>

			<p>Joshi tried to eat a handful of grass. It did taste a bit chocalety, but mostly it tasted of grass. He couldn't eat it. "Fooey!" he said.</p>

			<p>Space Cow gave a thoughtful moo. "Seeing as you're a child, you might do better with some milk from this grass." she said. 
			Space Cow bustled about the spaceship &amp; produced a small bowl-like object. <br />
			"This should do for a cup," she said. "It's a spare cap for the fuel tank, but I assure you it's clean." </p>

			<p>The Tau-Ceti cow took the cup &amp; brought it back full of milk.</p>

			<p>Joshi drank some. It tasted just like chocolate brownies.</p>

			<p>Then it was time to go home. They got back into the spaceship &amp; Space Cow flew it back, dropping Joshi off at his house. 
			His Mum &amp; Dad gave him a big hug. </p>

			<h2>Epilogue</h2>

			<p>The next morning Joshi wondered if it had all been a dream. He had breakfast as usual. He went to nursery as usual.</p>

			<p>There was a big dent in the playing field though. Such as might be made by a small but well cared for planet.</p>
