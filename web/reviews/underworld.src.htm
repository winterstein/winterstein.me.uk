Horror is one of those genres that almost exclusively belongs to
Hollywood.  Frantic Assembly's new play though is a reminder that the
stage can be just as effective at scaring the wits out of an
audience. It combines theatre and dance to give an intense and
exciting show.

Loosely based on <i>Stanley Kubrick's</i> "The Shining", Underworld is
a story of ghosts and violence. Four women are stranded in a remote
house by snow and a power cut. They include <i>Lydia Baksh</i> as a
neurotic psychic who can see nasty things in the house's past. The
other women's initial high spirits change to fear as the bad omens
mount up.

Although the plot doesn't break any new ground, the characters are
fleshed out well, lifting the story considerably above the usual
standard for the genre.  
<br><br>

The cast are excellent, both as dancers and actors. The mix of text
and physical theatre works very well, especially the high-octane
nightmare sequences. Music - powerful driving stuff such as Nine Inch
Nails - is used to good effect. From the very beginning until the
final lights down, the audience is never allowed to relax. The pace is
(generally) fast. Plot development is brilliantly done, and the
tension builds up consistently to the story's violent end.

<br><br>

In terms of thrills, there's nothing quite on the level of, say, Jack
Nicholson coming at you with an axe.  After the superb build up, the
finale is something of a dissappointment: the `fight dance' is the
play's weakest point, and is stretched out too long.  <br><br>

Overall though, Underworld is professional and exciting. Ghosts,
murder and dance in a genuinely scary combination.
