Roberto Zucco
</font></b><br><br> -->
          <b>Playwright </b>- Bernard-Marie Koltes<br>
          <b>Company</b> - Bedlam<br>
          <b>Director -</b> Daniel Alicandro<br>
<b>Venue</b> <a href=http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/bedlam>Bedlam Theatre</a><br>
<b>Run ended 28th November</b><br>
 <br>

<i>Robert Zucco</i> is based on the real-life story of a young man who
murdered his father, was locked up, but escaped and went on a killing
spree. It's an unusual topic for a comedy, but then this is a very
unusual play. The script is stilted but articulate, and continually
flips from excellently witty comedy to matter-of-fact
brutality. Unexpected characters spout eloquent philosophy in a way that
feels distinctly french.  <br><br>

Koltes does not try to explain or excuse his anti-hero.  Zucco is a
cipher, by turns a cold-hearted killer and an inoffensive, quietly
charming, boy. His strongest characteristic is a lack of identity.
Koltes first got the idea for the play from seeing a wanted poster in
the Paris metro in which four completely different pictures of the
suspect were shown. Zucco worries that he might forget who he is, and
when asked to identify himself, he gives no name but lists the people
he has killed.  <br><br>

Zucco moves through a city of unpleasant people - pimps, bad parents and
uncaring bystanders - all of them trapped in cold and loveless
lives. Koltes is much harsher on these characters than on the
murderer. Unfortunately their natures are often too stylised and
exaggerated to be plausible. We do not recognise our world in his, and
this severely limits the power of the play.  <br><br>


This weakness is not helped by some flaws in <b>Daniel Alicandro</b>'s
production. The heavily stylised script gives enough space for the
company's inexperience to shine through. Nevertheless this production
largely succeeds. The set is minimal but imaginative, and suits the
play well. Crucially, <b>Hannu Rajaniemi</b> is most convincing in the
lead role. The result is a strange and very interesting piece of
theatre.
