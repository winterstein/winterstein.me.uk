Adapted from Gogol's short story of Russian social injustice, <i>The
Overcoat</i> is a refreshingly warm play about a man trying to get out
of the cold.  Akaky Akakevich is a simple-minded clerk leading a very
basic life.  He has few needs, but chastised by his superior and the
Russian winter, he must get a new coat. Around this framework Gogol
wove a tale about the plight of the common man caught in an uncaring
system, which <b>Moving Parts</b> have now transformed into an utterly
charming play.  <br><br>

Inspite of it's theme, this is a humourous play. The company have
translated the gentle humour of the story into some lovely playful
pieces of physical theatre. Even the nightmare sequence makes you
grin. With the bare minimum of props and set, they bring this story to
life.<br><br>

Moving Parts are based at the Wester Hailes community arts centre
(called <b>WHALE</b>) on the outskirts of Edinburgh. They have been
working together for several years now, and this is reflected in their
smooth ensemble performance. <b>Iain Bunt</b> makes an excellent job
of the central role, with good support from a versatile cast. It's
nice to see that a local group with limited resources can nevertheless
put on a first rate play.  <br><br>
