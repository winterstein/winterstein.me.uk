For a month the festivals take over this city. The centre throngs with
people and buzzes with energy. The Edinburgh festival attracts people
from all over the world - even one of the wettest Augusts on record
hasn't deterred (them|too many). Yet it passes many Edinburgh
residents by, or leaves them cold. However for ?? years the Festival
Radio Project has been involving local teenagers in the fringe - as
well as giving them valuable experience of media work (without the
drinking). Each year they take a group of 15-18 year olds, train them
in radio production, arm them with microphones and let them loose to
terrorise the festival.<br><br>

No-one is safe. A bewildered Clive Anderson was asked "Have you had
any success before?" (apparently he thinks he has). "First time in
Edinburgh pal?" was one of the questions Perrier nominee Alan Davies
faced. Back in the studio, the children edit the tapes of their
interviews and reviews into professional quality programmes that are
broadcast by stations such as ??, ?? and ??.  "They learn quickly and
well," said project director David Barras, "They're enthusiastic and
tend to be very computer literate these days."

"There's distinction between staff "
which I take to mean the

Initially run for the disabled, the project was thrown open to
children of all backgrounds this year as part of the council's `Go 4
It' summer programme of youth activities. It's run by volunteers with
equipment provided by local company Media Education. The staff are a
happy crew. "We get as much out of it as the kids." says Edinburgh
graduate Chrissy, "They're at that age where they become very
conscious about looking cool. It's great to see them gradually
dropping that and getting into something." ?? year old John
illustrates her point: "It was brilliant, really," he enthuses before
remembering to act hard, "I mean it was OK, y'know?"


Chrissy adds "It gives us a way to feel part of the festival."

This is the point of the project for both children and staff.

Most of these children hadn't been to the theatre before.

The variety of things on offer and the cost of seeing more than a few
are daunting.



The festival is a vibrant anarchic flowering of British (and world) culture.



It's a small project.

The project has already finished for this year, but should return next
year.


Good to find local children getting involved.
