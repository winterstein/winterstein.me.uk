Drum beats echo off stone walls and torches flare. Rough clad men run
through the audience and the air is thick with the threat of
violence. <b>Teatr Modjeska</b>'s offering to this year's Fringe is an
exciting interpretation of <b>Shakespeare</b>'s play about corruption
and disillusionment. This promenade production of <i>Coriolanus</i> is
done in the best traditions of physical theatre, and it succeeds
entirely to move and challenge it's audience.<br><br>

Led by the superb <b>Darek Maj</b>, the inspired cast bring to life
the subtle complexity of Shakespeare's play in a contemporary Polish
translation by <b>Stanislaw Baranczak</b>, and draw parallels with
post-communist Poland.  The drama is heightened by striking live music
from <b>Kormorany</b>, a legendary underground Polish rock band.
<br><br>

Performed in Polish with fragments of English, but nevertheless
accessible. Don't miss this play.<br><br>

Runs until 21 Aug (not Wednesdays) at 9:30pm (10:45).
Tickets &pound;10 (&pound;7)<br>
