We all have at least one friend - or perhaps an elder relative - like
John Sinclair.  A nice man; friendly to others and at peace with
himself. Someone you can relax with. Unfortunately, also a boring man,
with a vast supply of dull anecdotes.<br><br> 

Angels and Bagpipes has a simple format: One man on stage telling you
stories from his life. The show is unscripted. Sinclair freely
meanders from subject to subject in a very mellow manner.

However his stories never seem to go anywhere. He's honest, but this
is more of a mistake than a virtue. His show lacks the humour to be
comedy, and lacks the insight to be anything else.
<br><br>

Playing to a happy-drunk crowd, he didn't raise a single laugh. But
then he didn't tell a single joke.  Much of his routine is based on
running through the jobs he's failed at. He could well add 'comedian'
to the list.
