Eddie Kray - illegitimate son of Reggie - is a violent but inept
cockney ganster in this new comedy by Stephen and Trevor Ginn.  To
sort out his business difficulties he calls in a big city consulting
firm:<br>
<i>
"Who are these merchant bankers Eddie?"
<br> "Actually we're management
consultants."
</i>
<br><br>

The plot explores every angle of the basic joke, including some worth
ignoring, but never really gets interesting. The plot is not the point
though. Go see it for the lovely moments of corporate management
babble and some Lock-Stock style comedy criminals (<b>Dave Robson</b>
particularly enjoys himself in the lead role).
