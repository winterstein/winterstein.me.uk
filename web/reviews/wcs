Many years ago Sam (<b>Daniel Glover</b>) committed a crime to
horrible to mention. Now he has returned home, a pitiful wreck.  His
sister Molly (the beautiful <b>Laura Glover</b>) is determined to
rehash the past.  She forces him to tell his story to an audience of
motheaten old toys as if it were a child's bedtime tale.<br>

"No."<br>

Storytime is dark and intense piece with truly first rate acting. The
'bedtime story' format is somewhat contrived, but used well. The play
jumps back and forth from the present day to the sibling's childhood,
but it's tightly paced and flows well. The simple set and production
are effective, making it quite claustrophobic.  <br><br>

Strangely, Sam's crime - and the dark side to his character that it
implies - are never really examined.  <b>Emily Hunka</b> is clearly a
talented writer. However she lacked the courage here to get to grips
with her subject matter. As a result, even at the end we don't believe
that there could be a monster behind such a nice charming
brother. This undermines some of the play's aims, and leaves it
without a sense of closure.  What is left though is an excellent study
of the relationship between him and his sister. <b>Birthwrite</b> show
a lot of potential, and there is much to recommend here.
