<br><br><b><font size="4">
Woyzeck - Strode's Theatre Company
</font></b><br>


These are some notes I made intended as constructive criticism for the
company.<br><br>


I felt this production is lacking in gravity, without which the play does not
work.  Lines are often either hammed or delivered lifelessly.  In
particular:<br>

It sometimes feels like Marie is delivering her lines by rote. This is
worst when she exits after delivering a line.<br>

I didn't like The Captain being hysterical. Certainly there is much in
his character that is ridiculous, but he should never be silly. There
are several ways to play him: he can be angry with Woyzeck, or treat
him with pure disdain. I would be tempted to play him as a world-weary
man who is also pompous and arrogant.  <br>

The Doctor is symbolic of science. If you wish to play him as
egotistical, then do so in a subtler manner. Otherwise, there is the
danger that his role in the play is drowned by an over-the-top
performance.<br>

These two characters (The Doctor and The Captain) are meant to be
symbolic of the inhuman forces that oppress Woyzeck. Inhuman forces
oppressing humanity are not clown-like in my experience.<br><br>

The physical theatre aspect looks somewhat unrehearsed. This sort of
thing should be more polished if it is to add to the play. Also the
number of dancers on stage can overshadow the speaking parts - which
is partly due to the small stage space. Some suggestions for this are:<br>

(a) Cut down on the number of dancers on stage<br>
(b) Further blur the distinction between characters and dancers by using the dancers to 're-inforce' lines.<br>
(c) Get the speaking characters to put more power into their delivery.<br>
 <br>

In fact the venue is generally unsuitable for such a production. This
venue suits a claustrophobic play (see Storytime if you have the
chance for an example of this). Woyzeck can be either claustrophobic
or full of deep empty spaces. If you want to make it claustrophobic in
C venue, perhaps you could try positioning dancers around the
audience. At the moment it is merely crowded.<br><br>

Good points: The costumes were nicely done. The bits of live music
were good.  It is good that you can experiment and didn't simply
follow an already trodden path. These comments should not deter anyone
from that.  <br>

 Essentially, Woyzeck is a very challenging play. It could be that it
was too ambitious a choice for a young cast. <br>
