The production 
Lots of special effects

including fireworks and flying


Gail Watson makes a dashing little Peter Pan, but it is Andy Gray's
spendidly over-the-top Captain Hook who steals the show.  <b>Gerard
Kelly</b>'s no. 2 villian is the only weak link with some painful
jokes.

Excellent support from a team of dancers that include an acrobatic
troupe.

Excellent entertainment for any age.
