Reviewer Daniel Winterstein

Paines Plough's new show is a masterpiece of black humour. Torture,
murder and the extinction of the human race - in the most miserable
way - are all are grist for Gary Owen's dark jokes. Drowned World
presents a brutal totalitairan state where surface beauty is all that
matters. The ugly people have taken control, and are intent on
exterminating all who are beautiful. Why, they reason, should they be
reminded of their failings?

I think the title is a reference to Victor Hugo's comment that ideas
and values cannot be killed: "the new world which emerges from the
chaos will see the ideas of the drowned world soaring above it, winged
and full of life."  The triumphant ugly people have not found freedom
- they are still trapped by their old failings and selfish desires.

If I have to fault this play - and I am hesitant to do so - it would
be that it hits out at an easy target (the worship of beauty and the
destructive shame associated with being ugly) and that none of the
characters are ever properly fleshed out into believable people.

The plot, which revolves around a couple on the run, has lots of
tension and drives the play along at a fair rate. The set fits this
strange dark fantasy well. It has - appropriately enough - a slightly
creepy underwater feel. The style is disjointed, freely mixing
different locations together, and frequently switching between
dialogue and narration. This suits the dry humour of the play, and the
cast deliver their lines perfectly. The result is very nasty, and very
funny.

Runs Until 24 August not 5th,12th,16th,19th.
