Many years ago Sam (<b>Daniel Gilmore</b>) committed a crime to
horrible to mention. Now he has returned home, a pitiful wreck. Unable
to face the world, he spends his days alone in the attic. His twin
sister Molly (the beautiful <b>Laura Glover</b>) though is determined
to rehash the past. She starts to tell his story to an audience of
moth-eaten old toys as if it were a child's bedtime tale, and forces
him to join in.<br>

Storytime is a dark and intense piece with truly first rate acting. The
'bedtime story' format is somewhat contrived, but used well. The play
flows smoothly, inspite of jumping back and forth from the present day
to the twins' childhood, and is tightly paced. The simple set and
production are effective, making it quite claustrophobic.  <br><br>

Strangely, Sam's crime - and the dark side to his character that it
implies - are never really examined.  <b>Emily Hunka</b> is clearly a
talented writer. However she lacked the courage here to get to grips
with her subject matter. As a result, even at the end we don't believe
that there could be a monster behind such a nice charming
brother. This undermines some of the plays' aims, and leaves it
without a sense of closure.  What is left though, is an excellent study
of the relationship between him and his sister. <b>Birthwrite</b> show
a lot of potential, and there is much to recommend here.
