<i>Novel Notes</i> by <b>Jerome K Jerome</b>, author of <i>Three Men
in a Boat</i>, is a light-hearted comedy on himself and his
society. On a dreary afternoon, a few friends who set about writing a
first rate novel, but get distracted telling countless short
anecdotes.<br><br>

The cast of four play parts from beetles to victorian gentlemen as
they act out the different tales. They're energetic and enjoy
themselves. It's a bit like watching children's TV as they dress up
and ham it up.<br><br>

Sadly the show doesn't quite work. The 19th century characters are
inevitably outdated, and the production is too jolly to be funny. A
shame; with a drier delivery a couple of the stories could be acidly
funny. Nonetheless <i>Novel Notes</i> is a happy amusing show.<br><br>
