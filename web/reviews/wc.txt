Good comedians are usually described with terms such as "hilarious",
"side-splittingly good", "I literally laughed my head off", etc. All
of which apply to Mark Thomas, but then so do "moving" and
"heartfelt". You don't usually hear that said about a stand-up comic;<br>
but then this isn't a normal stand-up show. Thomas is as much a
political activist as a comedian, and he delivers an intense mix of
facts, real stories and comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remeniscent of no-one else.<br>
<br>
The focus of the show is the Ilisu dam - a despicable (British
government backed) project in Turkey - and efforts to stop it. This
provides a wealth of material that is unconventional to say the least
(rape, torture, murder, western hypocrisy). He also has a few things
to say on the subject of just wars.<br>
<br>
Thomas has an easy manner and also takes the piss out of left wing
groups ("Friends of the Earth are furious, they're tutting and some of<br>
them are holding candles.") and especially himself. He soon has the
audience in the palm of his hand. He is cruder (e.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;comparing the
USA's promise to protect the Iraqi Kurds, to when a big man in prison
says `You gonna be my wife'), funnier and more emotional than on TV.
At over two hours it's a long show, but never dull. The energy by the
end of the show is incredible. People cried.<br>

Contains harsh facts which many people may find upsetting.<br>
