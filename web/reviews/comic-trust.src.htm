Comic-Trust are a trio of Russian clowns.  For the Bongo Club's
opening cabaret, they performed a somewhat surreal musical piece.  It
involved them miming and tap-dancing to a Russian song whilst
pretending to be puppets.<br><br>

It was light-hearted cabaret material. The humour was gentle, the music
nice, and the tap-dancing reasonably good.<br><br>

The full show promises "clownery with quackery, pantomime, puppetry,
slapstick, sketches and crazy slavonic dances". We will keep you
posted.
