Serge was the passion of Paola's life. A drummer, whose career took a
cocaine nosedive.  Many years later his younger brother Raymond - also
a drummer - enters her life.  Raymond has a chip on his shoulder. He
wants to exhume the past and cut it to pieces. The result is a battle
over the true version of Serge and Paola's relationship.

<br><br>

<i>The Ballad of Crazy Paola</i> is infused with drumming. The fusion
of music and text works to great dramatic effect. So it is strange
that, as a whole, the play has no sense of rhythm. It's tone is
inconsistent, with jarring jumps of style.  The script is stylized one
moment and natural the next. Raymond and Paola's conversations swing
from banal to heavy handed and back, and the quality of writing is not
up to the Traverse's usual high standards. The overall effect is a
disjointed mess of a play that never really goes anywhere.  <br><br>

The production however is good.  A stylishly minimal set, based on a
sumo wrestling ring, gives the freedom of movement the play
demands. <b>Kathryn Howden</b> and <b>Billy Boyd</b bring to life as
much of the script as they can, and make the rest bearable. And when
the drumming and the text work together; well it has it's moments.
