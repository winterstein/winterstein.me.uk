The Edinburgh festival attracts people
from all over the world - even one of the wettest Augusts on record
hasn't deterred (them|too many). Yet it passes many Edinburgh
residents by, or leaves them cold. However for ?? years the Festival
Radio Project has been involving local teenagers in the fringe - as
well as giving them valuable experience of media work (without the
drinking). Each year they take a group of 15-18 year olds, train them
in radio production, arm them with microphones and let them loose to
terrorise the festival.<br><br>

No-one is safe. A bewildered Clive Anderson was asked "Have you had
any success before?" (apparently he thinks he has). "First time in
Edinburgh pal?" was one of the questions Perrier nominee Alan Davies
faced. Back in the studio, the children edit the tapes of their
interviews and reviews into professional quality programmes that are
broadcast by stations such as ??, ?? and ??.  "They learn quickly and
well," said project director David Barras, "They're enthusiastic and
tend to be very computer literate these days. There's little distance
between staff and the kids." - which I take to mean the children work
well rather than the staff are immature and skive off to smoke behind
the bike sheds.  <br><br>

Initially run for the disabled, the project was thrown open to
children of all backgrounds this year as part of the council's `Go 4
It' summer programme of youth activities. It's run by volunteers with
equipment provided by local company Media Education. The staff are a
happy crew. "We get as much out of it as the kids." says Edinburgh
graduate Chrissy, "They're at that age where they become very
conscious about looking cool. It's great to see them gradually
dropping that and getting into something." ?? year old John
illustrates her point: "It was brilliant, really," he enthuses before
remembering to act hard, "I mean it was OK, y'know?"  <br><br>

Most of these children hadn't been to the theatre before. For many
modern teenagers theatre is simply not part of their experience. Also
the sheer variety of things on offer at the fringe and the cost of
seeing more than a few can be daunting.  The Edinburgh festival is a
vibrant anarchic flower of British (and world) culture.  For a month
it takes over the city. The centre throngs with people and buzzes with
energy - and the Festival Radio Project gives a handful of teenagers a way
to be part of that.

year.</i>
