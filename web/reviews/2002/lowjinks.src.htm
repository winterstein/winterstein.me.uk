(insert killer introduction here)
Low Jinks is a postmodern clown show, a show about trying to be funny. 
Stuart Goldsmith puts on a courageous performance in what is virtually a one man show. Initially wildly enthusiastic ("You'll leave here purer beings!") he becomes downbeat as a string of man-walked-into-a-bar jokes fall flat, and he is harassed by a disembodied Irish voice. A cardboard box is brought on containing a miniature version of the show, whose clown seems to be doing much better: squeaky voiced pearls of wisdom are greeted with rapturous squeaky applause. Meanwhile Stuart Goldsmith's wind up rhino fails to work.
<br><br>

Its strange, very clever, and occasionally quite funny. It keeps threatening to dive into serious territory, but shies away. Much of the time it makes you feel a little awkward, which is deliberate, but nevertheless - well, awkward. Still, you get to play with balloons, which is fun and leaves you feeling happy. You, yes you.
