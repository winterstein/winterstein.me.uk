Ian McEwan is one of Britain's leading contemporary authors. Yet at this sold-out book festival talk, he spoke more about science than literature.
<br><br>

McEwan's most recent novel, <i>Atonement</i>, made the Booker shortlist and is hailed by many as his greatest. It deals with issues that he avoided as a younger writer, notably class.  As a younger writer, McEwan confessed a desire to shock (incest in <i>The Cement Garden</i>, sado-masochism in <i>The Comfort of Strangers</i>). Finding the English novel “grey”, he was influenced by American writers like Philip Roth, John Updike and Saul Bellow. Earlier novels <i>A Child in Time</i> and <i>Enduring Love</i> are now A-level set texts. Today’s sixth form students apparently annotate them with comments like “Bullshit”. McEwan, a jovial man, is flattered.

When asked about his modern influences, McEwan mentioned Mark Haddon, whose <i>Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> concerns a boy suffering from Asperger’s Syndrome (a mild form of autism). However he said that, apart from his old favourites, he now prefers to read history and science. He was critical of the layperson's refusal to engage with science, contrasting it with attitudes towards music, where everyone - not just musicians - can and does talk about music.

As a young man he was the victim of a trend to make liberal arts students study maths at AS-level. Initially reluctant (of course), he now recalls the paradise of understanding calculus temporarily (knowing “if I sneezed, I’d lose it”). He might have sneezed a couple of times since, but still retains an avid interest in science.

Favourite scientists include Darwin. McEwan suggested evolution can give rational explanations for the non-rational elements of human nature. This seeming paradox is resolved by the fact that what is rational for our genes isn't necessarily rational for us. Even love, he thinks, can be explained in terms of evolution:
If we were in control we would never fall in love; not all-consuming love. Rationally we would know that there must be someone better out there. Yet love is needed for human survival, so evolution has taken it out of our control.
<br><br>

McEwan is a firm believer in rationality. Mary Shelley and William Blake gave it a bad name, he argued, yet the very social justice of which they were proponents is a product of rationality. However he is not an uncritical supporter of science, warning against the "dangerous divorce of intelligence from emotion".
