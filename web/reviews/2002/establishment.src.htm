<i>The Establishment</i> - which starts at 1am - sees C venues moving into the territory of Gilded Balloon's <i>Late and Live</i>. A fiver (half the price of <i>Late and Live</i>) gets you 3 hours of stand-up comedy with a late-licensed bar to make sure no-one sobers up. Each night has a different line up, chosen from around the fringe, making it an unpredictable show.
<br><br>
Opening act <b>Lucy Porter</b> was good, but the star of the show was the hilarious (and political) <b>Hils Barker</b>. She's in the finals for the Telegraph's Open Mic Award, and should get it if there's any justice in the world. A piece of classical Indian dance provided a welcome if somewhat random break. Quality is variable. Ironically <i>Late and Live</i> are the establishment who get the known names, and <i>The Establishment</i> are the young upstarts. Some acts are best forgotten, but overall it was an excellent end to the evening.

Runs until 25th August, 1am-3am. £5
