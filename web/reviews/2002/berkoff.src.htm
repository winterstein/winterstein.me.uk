How is Art to respond to the terrorist attack of September 11th? How is anyone? Because there must be responses; the impact of the tragedy demands it. This question is especially important to theatre. When the world changes, theatre reacts faster - and perhaps more democratically - than film or books. Hence this year's festival has half a dozen shows dealing with the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. Not surprisingly, most are by American companies, but <i>Requiem For Ground Zero</i> is a late addition to the programme by British actor/writer/director <b>Steven Berkoff</b>.
<br><br>

It is in the form of a long poem delivered by Berkoff alone, chronologically charting the days' events. It's powerful emotive material. Berkoff laces it with a subtle dark humour, which works to heighten the emotional content. His performance is mesmerising throughout. Larger than life, he moves and speaks with a virtuoso feel for gesture and rhythm.
<br><br>

Unfortunately though, the poem itself is too simplistic to work well. Much of its imagery is obvious; almost cliched. There is very little insight or understanding here, either of the world that produced the disaster, or of the people caught up in it. The characters are two-dimensional: Evil Villains, Innocent Victims and Brave Heroes, rather than real people. The dead were real people, they were more than just Innocent Victims and Brave Heroes.
<br><br>

The effect of this simplification is to keep the tragedy at arms length. <i>Requiem</i> tries to take us inside the hijacked planes and the burning towers, with the aim of producing a moving elegy to the dead. Instead it only recreates the feeling of being a horrified spectator on September 11th. Berkoff is a brilliant performer, but on this occasion his material is too weak. The end though - a moving call for the West to show understanding - is an important message.

6pm, runs until 26th August, except 19th.<br>
