Jessica, a chorus line dancer, always dreamt of being famous. Now she is famous, but not in the way she expected: wanted for accidentally killing a young girl. She has gone to ground - literally, hiding out down a hole in a small outback town. Her boyfriend brought her there, but he's been gone two weeks... Starved of company, she gradually loses the plot.
<br><br>
Tangled attempts to look at the media's reckless way of handling sensational crimes. Unfortunately an isolated hole in the ground doesn't provide a good position from which to do this. Noni Bousfield gives a brave performance, although her deterioration into insanity isn't convincing. A worthy but deeply flawed play.
