Upside Down is a dance piece inspired by Rembrandt's "The Anatomy of Doctor Tulip". It is skilfully performed by three young Russians to <i>Concerto for Strings and Weird Noises</i> (a haunting aural background, although with a few inexplicably wrong numbers). It is dark, original and unsettling - but at times becomes too incoherent to take its audience with it. A plot loosely based around Mary Shelley's Frankenstein sees a dysfunctional family knitting themselves babies, dancing pas-de-deux, merging doctor-patient roles and knifing each other in the back. The action takes place in an ingenious set, and is eccentrically costumed (though at times barely costumed at all).
<br><br>
It starts well, but then plot goes out of the window in favour of some indulgent and over-long pieces. Although technically brilliant, the choreography is sometimes emotionally flat. Moments of humour lighten a show which does not seem to have any point, but to exist merely as a well-executed visual curiosity.
