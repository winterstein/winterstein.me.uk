According to the programme, the theme for putting these three together
was writers who "cast away convention".
For example, Dan Rhodes book <i>Anthropology</i> consists of 101
stories about love, each exactly 101 words long (he reads a few;
they're very funny). Tibor Fischer wrote a book from the point of view
of a Grecian urn, and has another with chapters such as 'Things I
don't want to write about' (followed by a blank page).
The chair asks how they see the role of convention in literature. The
discussion of this is short.
Both Tibor Fischer and Dan Rhodes agree that, although their writing
could be called unconventional, this was never the intention. Nor do
they think there is much value to throwing away conventions just for
the sake of it.
"I'd like to quash now any accusations of originality," adds Rhodes,
"It's just that I read unconventional books."
Matt denies being unconventional, and that is that.
