<i>Touching Soft Things</i> is an adaptation of 
Steinbeck's sad but beautiful book "Of Mice and Men".

reset to modern England

which saves us from bad american accents

unfortunately it makes a mess of the ending:

Tom and Pete are migrant labourers

Pete is immensely strong but retarded. Tom looks after him and protects him

A dream where they will get a small farm together and raise rabbits
for Pete to stroke

There is a moment it seems possible.

The cast do a good job with most of the story

however the final section

Steinbeck's heartbreaking simple sparse prose doesn't translate well
to the stage. Worse, the threat of lynching - which would be
ridiculous in a modern english setting - is simply dropped from the
plot. Without this, Tom's final act of kindness makes no sense.

Nevertheless this is a competent play (although for the same money and
time you could read the book).<br>
