Benet Catty Productions present a double-bill of Hollywood
satires. <i>David Mamet</i>'s Speed-the-Plow followed by <i>Ben
Elton</i>'s Popcorn - an electric piece of theatre.  <br><br>

Speed-the-Plow is the weaker show - in both production and script.
Nevertheless it's a sharp and funny play. Quintessential Mamet, it has
cynical hard-talking American men - studio execs in this case - but
with gentle and quite sympathetic characterisation. On the eve of a
big deal, Bobby (<i>Gerry Howell</i>) and Charles (<i>Brett
Goldstein</i>) make a bet about the sweet new secretary. Things get
ugly.  <br><br>

Popcorn is a fast moving and gripping production. The Mall
murderers, Wayne (<i>Jon Drever</i>) and Scout (<i>Emma Cooper</i>), are addicted to
glamorous, violent movies, and divide their time between watching
television and going on exhilaratingly flippant killing
rampages. Bruce Delamitri (<i>Brett Goldstein</i> again in a marathon piece
of acting), as the director of their favourite movie, is their hero.
The play starts when they go to visit him and actress Brook (<i>Hannah
Pettifer</i>), who is hoping for a part in his next film. Casually holding
them at gunpoint, Wayne struts around in the style of his movie heros
while Scout watches him admiringly with an intriguing mixture of
shyness at being with such important people, and violence, showing a
complete disregard for human life.
<br><br>

Director <i>Benet Catty</i> manages to interweave the reality of the hostage
situation with the fiction of Bruce's violent films, in which killing
occurs in slow motion to a rock and roll sound track. The play is a
satirical thriller which examines the question of responsibility for
one's own actions, and the role of violent films in creating or
mirroring society.
<br><br>

The cast and director do full justice to one of Elton's funniest
plays. Thoroughly recommended!
