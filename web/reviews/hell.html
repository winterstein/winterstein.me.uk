<b>Drams</b> a wee one<br>
<b>Venue</b> Hill Street Theatre (124)<br> 
<b>Address</b> 19 Hill Street, 226 6522<br>

In an intense performance, <b>George Dillon</b> delivers two
monologues on loneliness and suicide. He is a talented actor and this
is a powerful piece of theatre.<br><br>

"Hell" said Sartre, "is other people" but <b>Stephen Berkoff</b> makes
a convincing case that actually, hell is being alone.  A man sits in a
chair, naked apart from his underwear.  Speaking softly he tells us
about his life. It's a frank confession of emptiness, stemming from a
lack of someone to love. The story is shorn of most personal details;
we don't even learn the man's name. The effect is to make the play
universal in it's reach. The writing is unflinching and deadly
accurate. Everyone emphasises with the man on stage.

<br><br>

<i>Dream of a Ridiculous Man</i> presents another suicidal and lonely
man, but it has a kernel of blind optimism that is a welcome uplift.
Here Dillon switches to an energetic style that feels somewhat
overacted - his understated delivery of <i>Hell</i> is more effective.
This piece is more ambitious in what it has to say. The dream includes
a sharp little satire of human society. It's less emotionally
powerful, but a good counterpart to <i>Hell</i>.<br><br>

This is brave theatre: one man, emotionally stripped bare on stage
(twice). The message is simple and as ancient as mankind: both plays
speak eloquently of the need for love, and the damaging effect of it's
absence.  <br><br>

Runs until 27 Aug, not 20th, 22nd or 25th at 5:55:pm (7:25).
