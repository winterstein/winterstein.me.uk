This is a unique show - a collection of poems on the holocaust set to
music. It is simple but moving. Some of the songs are hauntingly
beautiful and will linger in the mind long after the performance is
over.<br><br>

The lyrics - which include work by two nobel laureates - are very
powerful. A couple of pieces are responses to the holocaust but most are
auto-biographical. It's the mix that hits you. There are terrible images, of
course, and horrific gallows humour as in <i>Children</i> (<i>"You'd
think it would be harder to kill the children. It's easy. They can be
thrown in the air for target practice or snapped over the
knee..."</i>). However these are intertwined with poems of life,
dignity - even love.  And they have the terrible force of being
true.   One is a last message from a child, thrown from a
train: <i>"Don't cry for me Mummy, I am strong."</i> Also included is
a meditation on more recent genocides by British poet <b>Kevin
Carey</b>: <i>"Remember Dachau which you said, would never happen
again."</i><br><br>

The quality of playing is excellent. The music has an appropriately
eastern european feel to it and sets of the poems well. Soft sad
waltzes predominate, although a couple of pieces are pared down to
rhythm and a tortured violin. <br><br>

There are flaws to this show (most notably <b>Bill Smith</b> is a
better composer than singer) but the strength of the poetry shines
through. It must be the most tragic moving show in the
festival.<br><br>


Runs until 17 Aug at 1:pm (2:30).
