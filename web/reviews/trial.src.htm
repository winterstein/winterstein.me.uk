"Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K. for without his
having done anything wrong, he was arrested one fine morning." Thus
begins <i>The Trial</i>, one of the most important novels of the
twentieth century. It is a nightmare tale of a normal man being
destroyed by sinister implacable forces that he never
understands: K. is finally executed without ever learning what he was
arrested for in the first place.
<br><br>

This adaptation and staging are competent, but lack any
sense of darkness.  The paranoia, despair, black humour and madness of
Kafka's tale are all missing. A narrator coldly watches the
story unfold. This device works well, but it's not enough, and the
bulk of the play falls flat. The sexual parts of the story are handled
without subtlety, drowning out several scenes. 
<!--Worst of all X plays Josef K. in the style of a children's TV
presenter.-->  <br><br>

The Trial is Kafka's blackest work: evil is everywhere, acquittal or
redemption impossible, effort and struggle only indicate man's
impotence. There are already several adaptations by luminaries such as
<b>Orson Welles</b> and <b>Steven Berkoff</b>. It would be unfair to compare a
student production with either of these. There is no comparison.
