<b>Address</b> 117 Nicholson Street, 667 2212<br>
<br>

A darkened bar, a laid back atmosphere. A man sits at a piano smoking
and telling stories about life on the road: masturbation, beer,
genetic engineering and his faithful dog. The guitarist just smokes
and plays.<br><br>

<i>Slaughterhouse Lounge</i> is somewhere between a piano bar and a
stand-up comedy routine. The jokes are mostly toilet humour, but
<b>Gerald Tyler</b>'s deadpan ironic delivery makes it feel like
something much deeper. The music is good smooth blues. Sleazy but
cool, this is a great show to finish the evening with.<br><br>

Runs until 26 Aug at 9:10pm (10:10).
Tickets &pound;6 (&pound;5)<br>
