An extended and wholly superior music video. <b>Errollyn Wallen</b>
plays piano and sings. Her voice is rich, and supported by a string
quartet she creates a sublime ethereal flow of music.<br><br>

Behind is a flow of images by <b>The Honey Brothers</b>. This forms
the backdrop to a series of pieces by Royal Ballet dancer <b>Tom
Sapsford</b>. It is a rare delight to see a dancer of such ability up
close. Sapsford is strong yet graceful, and his dancing fluently mixes
sensuous flow with moments of stillness.<br><br>

<i>Jordan Town</i> is a treat for the eyes and ears. Superb on many
levels.<br><br>

Run ends 18 Aug. Tickets &pound;8 (&pound;6). CDs on sale at the box office.<br>
