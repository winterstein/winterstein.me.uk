<i>Sexual Perversity in Chicago</i> is a great title, even if it does have little to do with the actual play - a comedy about the lovelife of modern 20 somethings. 
The arc of a love affair is plotted with a series of snapshot scenes. 
There's no perversity, and Chicago's never mentioned. To make up for this, sex is mentioned constantly.
<br><br>

It's not clear why this piece has been included with the hard-hitting political pieces that make up the rest of the Gilded Balloon's <i>civil:lies</i> season. Although <b>David Mamet</b> (Speed the Plow, Glengarry Glen Ross) has written some compelling drama, this early work is a deeply shallow play. Stereotyped characters and short scenes make it feel more like a TV sketch show than theatre. However the pace is fast and the humour's sharp. <i>Sexual Perversity in Chicago</i> has nothing to say, but says it well (and - being Mamet - with lots of crude language). 

<br><br>
Although it's not a demanding piece, it must be said that <b>Harriet Usher</b>'s production is faultless. The frequent scene changes are handled efficiently thanks to a well thought out set. The straightforward roles provide no challenge to a competent cast. Perhaps the star of the show is Bernie, a ridiculous misogynist who spouts streams of foul-mouthed eloquence. <b>Jonny Burr</b> plays the part with bug-eyed fervour. Forgettable, but very funny.
