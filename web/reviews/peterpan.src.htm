As far as I can tell, the <i>New Adventures of Peter Pan</i> are
pretty much identical to the old adventures - which is bot a bad thing
at all.  This production perhaps takes a few more liberties than
normal in telling the tale, but they stick to the original
swashbuckling plot of Peter Pan vs. Captain Hook, with a supporting
cast of pirates, indians, fairies, crocodiles and children. <b>Fenton
Gray</b>'s production emphasises style and fun. There's the usual
pantomime silliness, plus lots of special effects such as fireworks
and flying.  <br><br>

<b>Gail Watson</b> makes a dashing little Peter Pan, but it is <b>Andy
Gray</b>'s spendidly over-the-top Captain Hook who steals the show.
<b>Gerard Kelly</b>'s no. 2 villian is the only weak link with some
painful jokes.  There is excellent support from a team of
dancers. These include the <b>Acromaniacs</b>, a slapstick acrobatic
troupe.  It's a lavish but fun production. Great entertainment for
both genuine children and children who never grew up. <br><br>
