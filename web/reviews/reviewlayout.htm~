Ignore what the fringe programme says: this is a sketch show not a
play.  Moreover it's a student sketch show, and neither as funny nor
as clever as it should be.  Monty Python have nothing to fear but a
lot to answer for. There are a couple of nice jokes here; maybe enough
for a show a quarter of this length.<br><br>

Zany! Wacky! Rubbish!<br><br>


Runs until 18 Aug at 4:pm (5:15).
