<b>Reviewer</b> Daniel Winterstein </font><br> 

If the Monty Python crew had done pub gigs (with multimedia wizardry)
then they might have come up with something like this new show. It's a
surreal mixture of post-modern games and bizarre juxtapositions. Last
year's Perrier winners, <b>Noble</b> and <b>Silver</b> are clever and
creative - but they're also damn confusing and this isn't a show for
everyone.  <br><br>

 It's a highly original comedy show that constantly defies your
expectations.  Although - in terms of jokes - there isn't that much
material, what there is, is very funny. The props range from lion
suits to rubber dinghys. Pride of place are two large TV screens. The
audience though is their main prop, and they never tire of playing
with your minds.  <br><br>

There are some brilliant moments here. And none of it is ever
satisfactorily explained.
