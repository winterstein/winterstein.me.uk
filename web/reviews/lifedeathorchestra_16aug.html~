The music has an appropriately eatern european feel to it. Violins 

soft sad waltzs predominate
The quality of playing is excellent.

Some of the songs are hauntingly beautiful.


Also included is a simple meditation on more recent genocides by
British poet <b>Kevin Carey</b>: <i>"remember Dachau which you said
would never happen again"</i>

There are flaws (most notably <b>Bill Smith</b> is a better composer
than singer) but the strength of the poetry shines through. This must
be the most tragic moving show in the festival.<br><br>


Runs until 17 Aug at 1:pm (2:30).
