      Drams</b> 2 <br> 
      <b>Venue</b> Waverley Station / The Bongo Club (143)<br>

Passengers arriving in Edinburgh on 1st August were greeted by a
strange sight. Half a dozen people dressed in black with white faces
were performing a Butoh dance - an eery modern style from Japan. 
Most of them didn't bat an eyelash however. For this month, the
abnormal becomes normal, as Edinburgh becomes a city of art
freaks. It's festival time again.<br><br>

The performance continued in the Bongo club with a slight change. The
dancers moved within a white sheet tunnel, lit from behind to give
silhouettes. The effect of the silhouettes with hands pushing out
against the cloth is haunting.
<br><br>

Coming from post-war Japan, Butoh is a free form dance without rhythm
- or if there are rhythms they are slow: the rhythm of a dying star;
the death throes of an empire. It consists of very slow graceful
movements constrasted with quick jerky ones. This is reminiscent of
the kata dances in karate, yet completely opposed: improvised instead
of traditional, expressing weakness instead of strength.  The dancers
are very alone. Although they sometimes meet, the interaction is a
cold one.<br><br>

Butoh is very individualistic, yet abstracts away all personality
until there is only space, form and flow. What results is a haunting
meditation on loneliness.
<br><br>


This was Tetsuro's only performance in Britain. However there are
Butoh groups in London. In addition to Tetsuro's small troupe, two
women who had attended his workshop last week also performed.
