This is a unique show - a collection of poems on the holocaust set to
music. It is simple but moving. Some of the songs are hauntingly
beautiful and will linger in the mind long after the performance is
over.<br><br>

The lyrics - which include work by two nobel laureates - are very
powerful. It's the mix that hits you. There are terrible images, of
course, and horrific gallows humour, as in <i>Children</i> (<i>"You'd
think it would be harder to kill the children. It's easy. They can be
thrown in the air for target practice..."</i>). However these are
intertwined with poems of life, dignity - even love.  And they have
the terrible force of being true. A couple of pieces are responses to
the holocaust but most are auto-biographical.  One is a last message
from a child, thrown from a train: <i>"Don't cry for me Mummy, I am
strong."</i> Also included is a simple meditation on more recent
genocides by British poet <b>Kevin Carey</b>: <i>"Remember, Dachau
which you said, would never happen, again."</i><br><br>

The quality of playing is excellent. The music, which has an
appropriately eastern european feel to it, sets of the poems well. Soft
sad waltzs predominate, although a couple of pieces are pared down to
rhythm and a tortured violin. <br><br>

There are flaws to this show (most notably <b>Bill Smith</b> is a
better composer than singer) but the strength of the poetry shines
through. It must be the most tragic moving show in the
festival.<br><br>
