<br>

With Hurlyburly, the Bedlam has again succeeded in giving us a
polished and truly professional production. The cast and crew may be
students, but the performance is first rate and cannot be
faulted. Unfortunately, the play is terrible.
<br><br>

The play wants to be a savage satire of the Los Angeles lifestyle,
such as Bret Easton Ellis's <b>The Informers</b>. It fails. Instead,
David Rabe's script is a sub-Mamet mess that is as shallow as the
characters it portrays. The production does it's best, but there isn't
much it can do.

<br><br> The first half hour is like a sitcom, but with irritating and
unpleasant characters. It's entirely lacking in charm, however it is
reasonably funny. Except then the jokes dry up, but the `comedy' goes
on - and on. Three hours is a long time, especially for a play that
consists almost entirely of the semi-coherent ramblings of some
self-obsessed and not particularly interesting men (the female
characters are insultingly one dimensional, and hardly have any
lines). Over three hours; and about half a dozen decent jokes. There
are Shakespearean tragedies that are shorter, and have more
laughs.<br><br>

Anyway, my nature is too full of the milk of human kindness to dwell
further on the script (also review swearing guidelines prohibit a
truly accurate description). Instead, let's remember the excellent
acting of <i>Jerry Latter</I>, <i>Chris Perkin</i> and <i>Andy
Crawford</i>. They deserve better.
