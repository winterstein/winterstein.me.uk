Woyzeck, Georg Buchner's unfinished classic, is a very challenging
play.  The script is quite heavy, consisting of sparse disjointed
dialogue. Lines such as "even money rots" and "one thing after
another" are simply uttered without any context.  Woyzeck is the
common man, pulled in conflicting directions by duty, science and
nature. Eventually he snaps, and in a fit of sacred rage murders his
adulterous girlfriend.  Done well it is a darkly poetic piece, shot
through with moments of black humour.  Done badly - and here it is
done very badly - it is simply unwatchable.<br><br>

This production is entirely lacking in gravity, without which the play
does not work.  Lines are either hammed or delivered lifelessly. The
Doctor and The Captain - symbolic of the inhuman forces that oppress
Woyzeck - are hysterical and unconvincing. The physical theatre aspect
feels like it came out of a GCSE drama class, and adds nothing to the
play. It was far too ambitious a choice for such an inexperienced
cast.
