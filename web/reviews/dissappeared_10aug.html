(page 61)

<br>Drams</b> 2 and a half<br>

<b>Address</b> Edinburgh Central Library, George IV bridge (entrance via Cowgate), 620 6206<br>

A young woman meets a strange man in a bar and is never seen again.
Did he kill her? Or did she just... vanish? <br><br>

<i>Disappeared</i> presents The City (you know, the big anonymous one)
as a hell where everyone is trapped and everyone is alone. It views
modern city life as so bleak that completely disconnecting from
friends, family and possibly life itself can be seen as a triumph.<br><br>

Unfortunately <b>Phyllis Nagy</b>'s script is heavy handed, and only
the two leads have depth. <b>Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal</b> have done a
competent production though.<br>

Runs 5-11 Aug at 5pm (6:45).
Tickets &pound;6.50 (&pound;5.50)<br>
