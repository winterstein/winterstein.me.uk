Theatre Slava are a Swedish company whose plays are told through a
montage of songs. Their preview consisted of a couple of such songs.
These were choral pieces - perhaps closest to folk music - with only a
bass drum for accompaniement. At times several seperate songlines play
against each other, and individuals and groups emerge from the choir
before merging back together. The different voices mingle and
interweave to create rich and powerful effects. They combine singing
with physical theatre, and the result reaches out to have a very
direct effect on the audience.  <br><br>

The full show explores themes of feminine strength amidst violence and
despair. It draws on the ancient Greek tragedy of Cassandra - a woman
condemned to prophesy the truth but be ignored - updated to the recent
conflicts in the balkans.  However, since it does this in Swedish,
most of us will never know quite what's going on.  <br><br>

It shouldn't matter. Theatre Slava's strong stage presence and
evocative singing transcend the language barrier.  Expect a show that
is emotionally hardhitting, but ultimately beautiful.
