Regretably this review will be too late for you to catch what was an
excellent show. However I have no doubt that <b>Briony Redman</b> will
be back with another comedy next year. I really can't wait.<br><br>

<i>"God has a plan. Not a very well thought out plan, but he thought he'd
give it a go anyway..."</i>

So it is that Ben, recently deceased, is sent back to earth to be a
guardian angel to his best friend Matt. The plan might have worked
better if his girlfriend hadn't been in Matt's bed at the time, or if
the local pizza-delivery-girl-cum-witch hadn't got involved.<br><br>

<i>Angel</i> by <b>Briony Redman</b> is dead good, as it were. The
script sparkles with irreverent wit. It's sharp and clever (if
shallow) entertainment, and would make a very original sitcom if the
story didn't tie itself up so neatly.<br><br>

Matt spends most of the play strung out and hanging onto the thought
that he might only be crazy, so Ben gets most of the good lines.
Meanwhile God and the devil look on whilst playing Connect 4. Angels
sulk, girlfriends faint and one-liners fly. Brilliant.<br><br>

Runs 6-11 Aug at 3:15pm (4:15).
Tickets &pound;5.50 (&pound;4)<br>
