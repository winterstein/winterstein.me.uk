The Globalisation Debate - Naomi Klein, George Monbiot, John Burnside
&amp; Alan Rugman

</font></b><br><br>



The visible leaders of the world met in Genoa a month ago at the G8 summit. 
 
From his column in <i>The Guardian</i>, George Monbiot observed that: "One
seized the presidency of his country after losing the election.
Another is pursuing a genocidal war in an annexed republic. A third is
facing allegations of corruption. A fourth, the summit's host, has
been convicted of illegal party financing, bribery and false
accounting, while his righthand man is on trial for consorting with
the mafia. Needless to say, the major theme of [the summit was]
'promoting democracy'."

Two of the real fighters for democracy were at the book festival in
Edinburgh this week in a sell-out debate on globalisation.  <br><br>

<i>
a 30 second guide to the
largest most complex political issue of the day
</i>
<ul>
<li> Economic liberalisation (i.e. removing the powers of individual
countries) is altering the balance of power in favour of companies
over countries.

<li> The numbers are too big. The resources required to compete at a
national or global level favours mass-marketing over small businesses.

<li> Companies are becoming bigger through mergers and international
expansion. The largest companies now have more economic clout than
most countries.

<li> Hence the large multi-nationals now hold power without
responsibility.

<li> Simultaneously, the large brands are becoming increasingly
sophisticated at manipulating people and consolidating their power.

<li> For a variety of reasons (keeping the media barons on their side,
short term policies, fear - often justified - of a backlash from
business, old-fashioned corruption, etc.) politicians rarely stand up
to the multi-nationals. George Bush - supposedly the powerful leader
of the free world - is showing himself to be the dutiful employee of
the companies that put him there; only a powerful tool. If you think
that's an American problem then think again - <i>Captive State</i>
documents how democracy is being eroded here in Britain.

</ul>

<hr>
Bottom line: Our democratic systems are being eroded and 
individual choice limited by mass-marketed 'mono-culture'. Meanwhile
low skilled workers are kept poor and unempowered.

Naomi Klein shot to prominence with the highly acclaimed bestseller
<i>No Logo</i>, which documents corporate globalisation and the
opposition to it. George Monbiot's book <i>Captive State</i> covers
the same theme, but focuses on events in Britain. They are two of the
most important books on current politics, and essential reading for
anyone who wants to be informed on globalisation. Fortunately they are
also both very readable, with a good mix of analysis and
anecdotes. Klein and Monbiot write clearly, explaining complex issues
well without overly simplifying. Klein's writing is quite restrained,
but Monbiot has a tendency to get carried away with revolutionary
rhetoric - I half expected him to lead an angry mob of book
festival-goers out into the streets. Some find his rants hard to
swallow, however his research is impeccable.<br><br>

Their books are well researched indictments of the way things are
going. They make chilling reading, but Klein and Monbiot are not
doom-sayers. They also report on the rising opposition to the
corporate/brand take-over, including some inspiring David v Goliath
battles. They argue that an alternative - some form og global
democracy - is possible if we will it. This opposition is being
labelled 'the Pro-Democracy movement', although Klein describes it as
not so much a movement but a "mass coincidence", on account of it's
unstructured grass-roots nature. The big brands seem to be taking it
seriously - but so far their response has largely been to pump more
money into PR instead of changing their ways. <br><br>


Also on the panel were Scottish poet John Burnside and academic Alan
Rugman. An hour is really too short for four people to give talks and
hold a debate. Whilst it kept the speakers to the point, it also
prevented proper discussion. Burnside spoke on the cultural cost of
losing languages and added an artistic angle to the debate.  Rugman's
inclusion as devil's advocate didn't work so well. Klein and Monbiot
were allowed to dominate the event. <br><br>


Naomi Klein and George Monbiot make a strong case that democracy is in
trouble, threatened by subtle and insidious forces. The overall effect
of their books is somewhere between a horror story and a call to
arms. A grass-roots defence is needed - &amp; this means you.
