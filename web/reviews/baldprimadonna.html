This is the play that grew out of <b>Eugene Ionesco</b>'s
teach-yourself-English book and spawned absurdist theatre.  Mr and Mrs
Smith exchange cliched banal conversation.  Two dinner guests arrive,
who feel they've met somewhere before and are delighted to find that
they are in fact married.  An underemployed fireman turns up whilst
the maid provides a running commentary. All played by two actors with
one prop (a pipe) on an almost bare stage.  <br><br>

<i>The Bald Prima Donna</i> is a hilarious examination of absurdities
of human interaction and bourgeois manners in particular. The characters
speak in pseudo-cliches and pseudo-truisms: <i>"All doctors are
charlatans, and their patients too."</i> These disintigrate into wild
caricature and parody as conventional reality goes out the window.
<b>Donal Gallagher</b> and <b>Geraldine O'Grady</b> are completely
superb as everyone. Under <b>Ali Robertson</b>'s bold direction, they
dart about the stage, magically leaping from character to
character. An exceptional staging of a classic comedy. Book tickets
now.  <br><br>

Runs until 26 Aug at 4:55pm (5:40).
