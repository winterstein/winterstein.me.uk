Everything about this play is realistic: the kitchen set (with working
taps, kettle and oven), the well drawn characters - and also the flat
plot.<br><br>

After 15 years making her fortune in America, Ruth is returning home
to Ireland. Of course it's not long before the family reunion becomes
a family argument. The dialogue in <i>Midden</i> is spot on. The
characters are perfectly written and the acting is flawless.  <b>Morna
Regan</b>'s script flows well and contains enough decent jokes to
sustain it.<br><br>

Unfortunately the play doesn't go anywhere. By the end we have learnt
little more than we knew at the beginning. <i>Midden</i> draws the
surface of a world perfectly, but never goes beneath the surface.
