With four decent comedians on one bill - all doing substantial
routines - <i>The Off the Kerb Roadshow</i> is excellent value for
money. It's mostly the sort of stand-up you can find at any comedy
club, but done to an above average standard. There's nothing
groundbreaking here, but it's a nice way to end an evening.  <br><br>

Laid back on what he likes to call "alcohol", <b>Jason 'Jay' John
Whitehead</b> makes a most amiable compere. A lot of stand-up
comedians will pick on audience members (which is why the front row at
a comedy gig is reserved for extroverts). Jay is a welcome contrast to
this. He involves the audience - but makes them feel at home. The
result is that unlike most of the late night comedy around, <i>Off the
Kerb</i> is a relaxed show.<br><br>

<b>Shappi Khorsandi</b> didn't quite connect with the audience on the
night we saw. However there was good material in her act, and I expect
that it will improve dramatically once she's settled in
properly.<br><br>

<b>Mark Felgate</b> is an uncannily good ventriloquist, and the best
act here. He describes himself as the product of secret genetic
experiments involving Chris Evans, Eric Morecambe and Janet Street
Porter. So I am unsure as to where he got his hilarious talents
from.<br><br>

<b>Angie McEvoy</b> is perhaps the weakest link here. Even so she has
a plesantly entertaining routine, is probably better given a livelier
crowd, and would probably go down a storm with a hen party.
