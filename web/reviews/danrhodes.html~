Dan Rhodes brief career as a writer is almost up. He published his
first book <i>Anthropology</i> only a year ago. <i>Don't Tell Me The
Truth About Love</i> followed this year. A third and final book is in
the pipeline, but after that it's all over.
<br><br>
Initially it seems inexplicable: both his books got good reviews and
sold well. 



Appearing at the Edinburgh Book Festival though, he soon explained
the mystery.

He enjoyed writing before he was a writer. 

Since becoming a professional author though, he has had to deal with
the business side of writing. It has not been a pleasant experience.
In particular he his keen publishers

who he describes as "shape-shifting giant lizards"

Inspite
of being a basically sweet natured man, he is unable to go five minutes
without 




His prose is cut down to the bone

delivers ideas fast.
