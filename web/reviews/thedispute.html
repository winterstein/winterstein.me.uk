 In <b>Marivaux</b>'s <i>The Dispute</i>, a bizarre experiment asks
how men and women would behave if they weren't conditioned by
society. Four children are raised in complete isolation. Then at the
age of 18 they are let out into a garden where they meet each other.
What follows is a shallow but engagingly funny take on the nature
vs. nurture debate. The characters have the naivety and innocence of
toddlers, but the hormones of teenagers. In rapid succession they
discover vanity, desire, sex, jealousy and betrayal (as well as
puddles and jumping).  <br><br>

This is quite simply a perfect production. Director <b>Marie-Gabrielle
Stewart</b> gets the pace spot on, and makes good use of the lovely
George Square gardens. A talented cast really bring the play to life.
<b>Zannah Hudson</b> is excellent in the tricky main role of gangly
self-obsessed Egle. <b>Lily Lapenna</b>'s more assured Adine plays
well against her. The boys - played by <b>James Fletcher</b> and
<b>Thomas Pickering</b> - succeed in the striking the right note as
playful childish Romeos.<br><br>

Plus - if you're lucky with the weather - you get to watch it all
sitting in the park on a sunny afternoon with a picnic.
