          <br>
          There's real delight in hearing a new playwriting voice for the first 
          time. Both Daniel Winterstein, <b>An NHS Christmas</b> and Steve Potts, 
          <b>Painkillers</b> have talent. Both give us plays expressing dissatisfaction 
          with the NHS. Both present us with characters in extremis. But bleak 
          - as these two plays are - they are also enjoyable. <br>
          <br>
          The strength of <b>An NHS Christmas</b> is its witty language and polemical 
          vigour. Dark angry cynicism comes from Jeffrey, an elderly gentleman 
          as he talks to Alex, the young man who's found himself in geriatrics 
          because of lack of space. 'I could have afforded a luxury such as a 
          living wife' is Jeffrey's comment on how if he'd been rich he could 
          have bought a by-pass operation for his wife. But the play needs an 
          ending, one recognisable to the audience!<br>
          <br>
          The strength of <b>Painkillers</b> is the interaction between characters, 
          two overdose patients in a hospital ward. It's more integrated, character- 
          wise, than <b>An NHS Christmas</b> which drew the character of Jeffrey 
          so well that the other three characters were in his shadow.<b> Painkillers 
          </b>shows real tenderness between its characters. All the actors did 
          well. In <b>An NHS Christmas</b> <i>Dustin Hutchinson </i>did justice 
          to a wonderful part as Jeffrey and <i>Isabella Jakubas</i>, in a more 
          diffcult role was convincing as a disillusioned young nurse. <i>Liz 
          Berry </i> in <b>Painkillers</b> conveyed anguish so well I nearly cried.<br>
          <br>
          A little updating of hospital procedures is needed ( hospitals use machines 
          to take temperatures now, not thermometers). But these are brave plays, 
          well directed and managing to be theatrical within the restrictions 
          of most of the characters being confined to hospital beds. You can catch 
          the last performance of <b>An </b></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NHS
