If the Monty Python crew had done pub gigs (with multimedia wizardry)
then they might have come up with something like this new show. It's a
surreal mixture of post-modern games and bizarre juxtapositions. Last
year's Perrier winners, <b>Noble</b> and <b>Silver</b> are clever and
creative - but they're also damn confusing and this isn't a show for
everyone.  <br><br>

The show starts at the end, then proceeds through flashbacks and
rewinds. You never know where you are; you don't even know when the
show ends. It's a highly original comedy show that constantly defies
your expectations.  Although, in terms of jokes, there isn't that much
material, what there is, is very funny.<br><br>

The props range from lion suits to rubber dinghys. Pride of place are
two large TV screens. The audience though is their main prop, and they
never tire of playing with our minds. One man is pulled out of the
audience to perform a sketch about being pulled out of the audience to
perform a sketch. A member of the audience is given a goldfish bowl to
hold. At the end of the show, he is left still holding it and somewhat
bemused. Another one is sat on stage with a microwave placed in his
lap cooking snack food.  <br><br>

There are some brilliant moments here. And none of it is ever
satisfactorily explained.
