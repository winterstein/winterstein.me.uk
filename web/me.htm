Daniel Winterstein is currently at Edinburgh University where he is
doing as little as possible.  He a PhD student in Artificial
Intelligence, although he likes to think of himself as being a
methematician. This was his undergraduate degree; how he passed is one
of the great unsolved questions of mathematics.

<p>
He has canoed on the Amazon, gone white water rafting in the
Himalayas, hiked across a desert and up mountains, galloped down dried
up river beds, surfed, skied, wind surfed, jet skied, scuba dived,
snorkelled, fenced, rowed, rock climbed, abseiled, pot holed, flown a
glider and crashed a hovercraft. Cycled, canal boated, been
uncomfortable on camels, hitchhiked, slept on crowded trains luggage
chained to the seat, rode on the roof of a bus with Radiohead playing
on the tape recorder and the sun setting on the mountains, and been
caught speeding (80mph in a 30 zone) but was let off.

<p>
He has been lost so many times and so easily that those who know him
have come to believe he is permanently lost. His crime-fighting
abilities include cooking perfect brownies without a recipe or even an
oven, being able to say "I am a small cabbage" in five languages and
knowing all the words to Hotel California. After graduating, he plans
to celebrate. Later - much later - he aims to become an astronaut,
because there are no cowboys these days.

<p>
He sometimes wonders whether referring to himself in the third person
is worrying, psychologically speaking, or just charmingly eccentric.
