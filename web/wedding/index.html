<h1>Becca & Dan's Wedding</h1>

<h2>Who is getting married?</h2>

<p><img src="danNBecca.jpg" alt="Becca &amp; Dan" /></p>

<h2>Where?</h2>

<p>The wedding is at two venues in central Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The registry office is in Parliament Square (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=parliament+square+edinburgh&amp;sll=53.094024,-2.460937&amp;sspn=10.749169,31.640625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=55.950834,-3.189383&amp;spn=0.00978,0.030899&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr">map</a>). </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.edinburghmerchantcompany.org/">The Merchant's Hall</a> is at
22 Hanover Street, Edinburgh (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=22+Hanover+St,+City+of+Edinburgh,+United+Kingdom&amp;sll=55.950152,-3.18753&amp;sspn=0.156476,0.494385&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;ll=55.954126,-3.196206&amp;spn=0.009779,0.030899&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">map</a>).</p>

<p>Both venues are 5 minutes walk from the main train station (Waverley).</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>The wedding will be on the <strong>8th September</strong> 2007.<br>
The registry office ceremony is at <strong>3:30pm</strong>.<br>
This will be followed by readings and blessings at the Merchant's Hall at <strong>4:30pm</strong>,
followed by dinner and a ceilidh until midnight.</p>

<h2>What to wear?</h2>

<p>The dress code is "smart/casual" which we think means "dress however makes you feel good". Ceilidhs are quite energetic; high heels are not advised. The weather in Edinburgh at the end of the summer should be mild. We have ordered sunshine but cannot guarantee it. </p>

<h2>Is the invitation plus one?</h2>

<p>Yes. If you would like to bring a partner then please do. Please let us know when you reply.</p>

<h2>RSVP</h2>

<h2>Gifts</h2>

<p>To make present shopping easier - and avoid getting half a dozen toasters - we have put together a <a href="http://whattogive.com/list/view.php?tag=Daniel+Winterstein">gift list</a>. 
Please feel free to ignore it.</p>

<h2>Getting here</h2>

<h3>Train</h3>

<p>The London train takes 4 1/2 hours from Kings Cross. The wedding venue is 5 minutes walk from the main station (Edinburgh Waverley). Do allow time for the trains to be late.</p>

<h3>Plane</h3>

<p>Flying is slightly faster and tends to cost around the same as the train. The bus from Edinburgh airport to the city centre takes 1/2 hour (get off at the end of the line by the train station). If you fly, we ask that you offset the carbon emissions. We use <a href="http://www.ebico.co.uk/equiclimate/equiclimate.htm">Equiclimate</a>. It's cheap and they have been approved by the government.</p>
