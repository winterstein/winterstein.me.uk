<i>
Being a tenuous account of the life of Daniel Winterstein.

<p>

Daniel looks like a model; a scale model. Nevertheless he now stands
poised to sweep the nation and empty its rubbish bins.
<p>
Daniel is not originally from Scotland. He grew up in Chiswick, London. <!-- Southall, which
is where he got the idea that London is a shithole. Southall is not so
much the wrong side of the tracks as the wrong end of the tracks.  His
school was rough: open drug dealing, muggings were common, stabbings
not unknown, and it was little better outside the staff room. However -->
He was nice and well-behaved as a child, probably due to vitamin
deficiency. Then one day he discovered booze and sex, and nursery
school was never quite the same again. From an early age teachers
failed to spot his potential: "Daniel is more than a beast, and only
slightly less than a man," reads one report card, "We are confident
that with a few beatings he can be trained to do simple
tasks. Although to be honest we've beaten him pretty hard so far
without success."
<p>

<!--
Inspite of this he decided to go to Cambridge University. In the old
days Eton used to have a deel whereby the headmaster made a list of
his top students, posted it, and they automatically got places. Today,
Richmond Tertiary College has a similar deal, except with the local
MacDonalds. Somehow he got in; Richmond did have some wonderful
teachers, also newly uncovered records reveal that he lied in the
interview. When asked "Are you clever?" he said "Yes" and they
fell for it.
<p>
He found Cambridge, but only with the help of British Rail (direction
is a problem for him: he has been lost so many times and so easily
that those who know him have come to believe he is permanently lost,
and have given up looking behind the fridge or down the back of the
sofa). Cambridge is unlike anywhere else. One in three people there
are students, and it goes the other way too - one in three students
there are people. Initially Daniel was worried that people there would
look down on him because he came from a state school. This was not at
all the case however: they looked down on him because he's short.
<p> -->

It was two years ago now that he bit into a radioactive asparagus,
thus gaining crime-fighting super-powers. In his particular case these
were the abilities to make good soups and salads, and to sit in the
fridge doing nothing for days at a time.
<p>
Still a student, Daniel now lives on the justly maligned GNER service
between Edinburgh and London.  He has taken to drink, and generally
shows more potential than promise. After graduating he aims to become
an astronaut, because there are no cowboys these days.  He sometimes
wonders whether referring to himself in the third person is worrying,
psychologically speaking, or just charmingly eccentric.
