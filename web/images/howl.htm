<dt> I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by 
     <dd>madness, starving hysterical naked, 
<dt> dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn 
     <dd>     looking for an angry fix, 
<dt> <dd>    angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly 
     <dd>     connection to the starry dynamo in the machin- 
     <dd>     ery of night, 
<dt> who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat 
     <dd>     up smoking in the supernatural darkness of 
     <dd>     cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities 
     <dd>     contemplating jazz, 
<dt> who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and 
     <dd>     saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tene- 
     <dd>     ment roofs illuminated, 
<dt> who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes 
     <dd>     hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy 
     <dd>     among the scholars of war, 
<dt> who were expelled from the academies for crazy & 
     <dd>     publishing obscene odes on the windows of the 
     <dd>     skull, 
<dt> who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burn- 
     <dd>     ing their money in wastebaskets and listening 
     <dd>     to the Terror through the wall, 
<dt> who got busted in their pubic beards returning through 
     <dd>     Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, 
<dt> who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in 
     <dd>     Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their 
     <dd>     torsos night after night 
<dt> with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, al- 
     <dd>     cohol and cock and endless balls, 
<dt> incomparable blind; streets of shuddering cloud and 
     <dd>     lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of 
     <dd>     Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the mo- 
     <dd>     tionless world of Time between, 
<dt> Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery 
     <dd>     dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, 
     <dd>     storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon 
     <dd>     blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree 
     <dd>     vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brook- 
     <dd>     lyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind, 
<dt> who chained themselves to subways for the endless 
     <dd>     ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine 
     <dd>     until the noise of wheels and children brought 
     <dd>     them down shuddering mouth-wracked and 
     <dd>     battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance 
     <dd>     in the drear light of Zoo, 
<dt> who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's 
     <dd>     floated out and sat through the stale beer after 
     <dd>     noon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack 
     <dd>     of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, 
<dt> who talked continuously seventy hours from park to 
     <dd>     pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brook- 
     <dd>     lyn Bridge, 
<dt> lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping 
     <dd>     down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills 
     <dd>     off Empire State out of the moon, 
<dt> yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts 
     <dd>     and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks 
     <dd>     and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, 
<dt> whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days 
     <dd>     and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the 
     <dd>     Synagogue cast on the pavement, 
<dt> who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a 
     <dd>     trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic 
     <dd>     City Hall, 
<dt> suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grind- 
     <dd>     ings and migraines of China under junk-with- 
     <dd>     drawal in Newark's bleak furnished room, 
<dt> who wandered around and around at midnight in the 
     <dd>     railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, 
     <dd>     leaving no broken hearts, 
<dt> who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing 
     <dd>     through snow toward lonesome farms in grand- 
     <dd>     father night, 
<dt> who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telep- 
     <dd>     athy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos in- 
     <dd>     stinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas, 
<dt> who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking vis- 
     <dd>     ionary indian angels who were visionary indian 
     <dd>     angels, 
<dt> who thought they were only mad when Baltimore 
     <dd>     gleamed in supernatural ecstasy, 
<dt> who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Okla- 
     <dd>     homa on the impulse of winter midnight street 
     <dd>     light smalltown rain, 
<dt> who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston 
     <dd>     seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the 
     <dd>     brilliant Spaniard to converse about America 
     <dd>     and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship 
     <dd>     to Africa, 
<dt> who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving 
     <dd>     behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees 
     <dd>     and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fire 
     <dd>     place Chicago, 
<dt> who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the 
     <dd>     F.B.I. in beards and shorts with big pacifist 
     <dd>     eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incom- 
     <dd>     prehensible leaflets, 
<dt> who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting 
     <dd>     the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, 
<dt> who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union 
     <dd>     Square weeping and undressing while the sirens 
     <dd>     of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed 
     <dd>     down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also 
     <dd>     wailed, 
<dt> who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked 
     <dd>     and trembling before the machinery of other 
     <dd>     skeletons, 
<dt> who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight 
     <dd>     in policecars for committing no crime but their 
     <dd>     own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication, 
<dt> who howled on their knees in the subway and were 
     <dd>     dragged off the roof waving genitals and manu- 
     <dd>     scripts, 
<dt> who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly 
     <dd>     motorcyclists, and screamed with joy, 
<dt> who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, 
     <dd>     the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean 
     <dd>     love, 
<dt> who balled in the morning in the evenings in rose 
     <dd>     gardens and the grass of public parks and 
     <dd>     cemeteries scattering their semen freely to 
     <dd>     whomever come who may, 
<dt> who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up 
     <dd>     with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath 
     <dd>     when the blond & naked angel came to pierce 
     <dd>     them with a sword, 
<dt> who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate 
     <dd>     the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar 
     <dd>     the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb 
     <dd>     and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but 
     <dd>     sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden 
     <dd>     threads of the craftsman's loom, 
<dt> who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of 
     <dd>     beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a can- 
     <dd>     dle and fell off the bed, and continued along 
     <dd>     the floor and down the hall and ended fainting 
     <dd>      on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and 
     <dd>     come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness, 
<dt> who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling 
     <dd>     in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning 
     <dd>     but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sun 
     <dd>     rise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked 
     <dd>     in the lake, 
<dt> who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad 
     <dd>     stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these 
     <dd>     poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver-joy 
     <dd>     to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls 
     <dd>     in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses' 
     <dd>     rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with 
     <dd>     gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely pet- 
     <dd>     ticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station 
     <dd>     solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too, 
<dt> who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in 
     <dd>     dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and 
     <dd>     picked themselves up out of basements hung 
     <dd>     over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third 
     <dd>     Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemploy- 
     <dd>     ment offices, 
<dt> who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on 
     <dd>     the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the 
     <dd>     East River to open to a room full of steamheat 
     <dd>     and opium, 
<dt> who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment 
     <dd>     cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime 
     <dd>     blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall 
     <dd>     be crowned with laurel in oblivion, 
<dt> who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested 
     <dd>     the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of 
     <dd>     Bowery, 
<dt> who wept at the romance of the streets with their 
     <dd>     pushcarts full of onions and bad music, 
<dt> who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the 
     <dd>     bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in 
     <dd>     their lofts, 
<dt> who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned 
     <dd>     with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded 
     <dd>     by orange crates of theology, 
<dt> who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty 
     <dd>     incantations which in the yellow morning were 
     <dd>     stanzas of gibberish, 
<dt> who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht 
     <dd>    & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable 
     <dd>     kingdom, 
<dt> who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for 
     <dd>     an egg, 
<dt> who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot 
     <dd>     for Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks 
     <dd>     fell on their heads every day for the next decade, 
<dt> who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccess- 
     <dd>     fully, gave up and were forced to open antique 
     <dd>     stores where they thought they were growing 
     <dd>     old and cried, 
<dt> who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits 
     <dd>     on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse 
     <dd>     & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments 
     <dd>     of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the 
     <dd>     fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinis- 
     <dd>     ter intelligent editors, or were run down by the 
     <dd>     drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality, 
<dt> who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually hap- 
     <dd>     pened and walked away unknown and forgotten 
     <dd>     into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alley

<dt> who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of 
     <dd>     the subway window, jumped in the filthy Pas-

     <dd>     phonograph records of nostalgic European 
     <dd>     1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and 
     <dd>     threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans 
     <dd>     in their ears and the blast of colossal steam 
     <dd>     whistles, 
<dt> who barreled down the highways of the past journeying 
     <dd>     to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude 
     <dd>     watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation, 
<dt> who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out 
     <dd>     if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had 
     <dd>     a vision to find out Eternity, 
<dt> who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who 
     <dd>     came back to Denver & waited in vain, who 
     <dd>     watched over Denver & brooded & loned in 
     <dd>     Denver and finally went away to find out the 
     <dd>     Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes, 
<dt> who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying 
     <dd>     for each other's salvation and light and breasts, 
     <dd>     until the soul illuminated its hair for a second, 
<dt> who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for 
     <dd>     impossible criminals with golden heads and the 
     <dd>     charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet 
     <dd>     blues to Alcatraz, 
<dt> who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky 
     <dd>     Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys 
     <dd>     or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or 
     <dd>     Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the 
     <dd>     daisychain or grave, 
<dt> who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hyp 
     <dd>     notism & were left with their insanity & their 
     <dd>     hands & a hung jury, 
<dt> who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism 
     <dd>     and subsequently presented themselves on the 
     <dd>     granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads 
     <dd>     and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding in- 
     <dd>     stantaneous lobotomy, 
<dt> and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin 
     <dd>     Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psycho- 
     <dd>     therapy occupational therapy pingpong & 
     <dd>     amnesia, 
<dt> who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic 
     <dd>     pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia, 
<dt> returning years later truly bald except for a wig of 
     <dd>     blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible mad 
     <dd>     man doom of the wards of the madtowns of the 
     <dd>     East, 
<dt> Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid

     <dd>     ing and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench 
     <dd>     dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a night- 
     <dd>     mare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the 
     <dd>     moon, 
<dt> with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book 
     <dd>     flung out of the tenement window, and the last 
     <dd>     door closed at 4. A.M. and the last telephone 
     <dd>     slammed at the wall in reply and the last fur- 
     <dd>     nished room emptied down to the last piece of 
     <dd>     mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted 
     <dd>     on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that 
     <dd>     imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of 
     <dd>     hallucination 
<dt> ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and 
     <dd>     now you're really in the total animal soup of 
     <dd>     time

     <dd>     of the ellipse the catalog the meter & the vibrat-

     <dd>     through images juxtaposed, and trapped the 
     <dd>     archangel of the soul between 2 visual images 
     <dd>     and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun 
     <dd>     and dash of consciousness together jumping 
     <dd>     with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna 
     <dd>     Deus 
<dt> to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human 
     <dd>     prose and stand before you speechless and intel- 
     <dd>     ligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet con- 
     <dd>     fessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm 
     <dd>     of thought in his naked and endless head, 
<dt> the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, 
     <dd>     yet putting down here what might be left to say 
     <dd>     in time come after death, 
<dt> and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in 
     <dd>     the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the

      <dd>    where your condition has become serious and 
      <dd>   is reported on the radio 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland

      <dd>    the worms of the senses 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you drink the tea of the breasts of the 
      <dd>    spinsters of Utica 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you pun on the bodies of your nurses the 
      <dd>    harpies of the Bronx 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you scream in a straightjacket that you're 
      <dd>    losing the game of the actual pingpong of the 
      <dd>    abyss 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you bang on the catatonic piano the soul 
      <dd>    is innocent and immortal it should never die 
      <dd>    ungodly in an armed madhouse 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland

      <dd>    cross in the void 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you accuse your doctors of insanity and 
      <dd>    plot the Hebrew socialist revolution against the

<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>    where you will split the heavens of Long Island

      <dd>here O victory forget your underwear we're 
      <dd>free 
<dt> I'm with you in Rockland 
      <dd>in my dreams you walk dripping from a sea- 
      <dd>journey on the highway across America in tears 
      <dd>to the door of my cottage in the Western night</p>
