Early morning half light hung over the aisles. A few shoppers browsed slowly. Others in smart dress and clearly pressed for time, zipped straight to the things they needed. The supermarket was mostly quiet. Although the silence was frequently cut, the noises were solitary and personal. A mother and a businessman wandered in opposite directions down the dairy produce. She looked tired. Especially in comparison to her child, a brightly dressed girl who ran to and fro bringing yoghurts and chocolate mousses to be rejected. The man strolled, examined products for ingredients, compared others for price and in the end chose nothing from that aisle. Neither of them looked at the other, although the man smiled briefly at the child.<br>
Nancy looked up from the lens. The camera sat in a trolley hidden by biscuits, bread and frozen peas. She grinned warmly up at Mark and laughed lightly, "Equal parts wonderful and ridiculous."<br>
She was wearing a sky blue cotton dress with her long black hair tied back. Mark tried not to look at her too often. The dress was simple but flattering, drawn in nicely at the waist. It was a style she normally avoided, which Mark thought a shame. She said it made her feel fat. The aisles quickly filled up. By noon, the store was comfortably full, with shoppers of all types milling together under the harsh neon lights. The sounds of consistent commerce filled the air. The soft rumble of trolleys, rustle of goods picked up, goods put down, and the ringing of cash registers. The store would continue to steadily fill from now until six o'clock. Shooting from the shopping trolley no longer gave clear views down the aisles, only blurred shots of people passing. Mark had started doing quick aerial shots by standing on chairs the store manager produced for them. It meant exposing the camera, which inevitably got people's attention. <br>
"Damn it," Nancy remarked, "We can't pull a camera out and film without distracting people from doing the everyday thing that we want to film."<br>
Mark nodded, but he was more surprised by how little attention people paid them. Their behaviour was clearly odd - when not openly filming they were standing bent over a shopping trolley for several minutes. People noticed of course, but no-one actually stopped and asked what they were doing. Instead the curious looks were often followed by averted looks, embarrassed at having been curious. He wondered whether these people would look good on film or spoil the shots. She smiled his way again and he felt himself smiling back with his whole body. He was pretty sure it was love he felt for her, although it had built up gradually. Perhaps that was why he couldn't tell her. He'd wanted to many times recently, but the closest he'd ever got to confessing his feelings was quoting Prufrock in her birthday card. There had been signs that Nancy also entertained romantic feelings towards him, but he had analysed these endlessly until he no longer knew what anything meant. Telling her could spoil everything. He told himself it was better to wait, and if anything was meant to happen it would. He repeated this to himself like a mantra.<br>
Around them, people went about their daily business. Dinners were bought, alond with packed lunches and holiday suppliesOld ladies did their weekly shopping, congregating in corners of the supermarket for little chats. Two kids pushing shopping trolleys happily collided with each other. Phlegmatic staff circulated stacking the shelves as they emptied. An irate middle aged man in a union jack jumper complained at a woman in a blue uniform. She was smiling and trying to be helpful; he was demanding his rights. A young couple went down the aisles holding hands. A bored housewife looked after them wistfully. The checkout staff called to each other across the queues swapping jokes and gossip. They had codewords for insulting different types of rude customer.<br>
