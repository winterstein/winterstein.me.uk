"Hold me." she said, and of course I did. There were some soft sobs by my ear, but I think she was OK after I left. It was six-thirty. I still had time to catch dinner and then there was a whole evening with nothing to do.<br>
"I've just been dumped by Jessica," I told a couple of friends at dinner. Standard reactions all round. I manage to put a happy enough burble on. We don't talk about it for long, just the essential questions. The hall's too crowded for intimate conversation and I don't want to share this with the world just yet. The subject soon shifts to everyday things. Across the table from me Roland is trying to start a crusade against carrots on pizza. It's an issue I would normally feel strongly about, but tonight... My meal arrives but I only pick at it, though this has more to do with the food than how I'm feeling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards I try to watch a film, but I can't get into it so I go in search of other people. Stepping outside the cold air wraps me up immediately. An unfriendly wind blows across the courtyard, and I turn into it, opening my coat to let it flow around me. Looking up I see the weather is sulking and the stars are completely hidden. It's still only eight o'clock. I won't be able to sleep for hours, and I don't know what to do with those hours. I talk to a couple of people, but it's a Monday night and there's nothing going on. They are friends, guys I see all the time, but tonight the sparkle has gone from their eyes. They walk in empty little circles between the bar, the quiz machine and the telly. I haven't the strength to join them and share their boredom. Nothing appeals to me. Books, work, alcohol; all seem equally meaningless. I roam from person to person; at least it's moving.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end up sitting in my room with William. He casts himself in the role of the romantic failure, and generally responds with jealousy if I try to talk about my problems. Which is perhaps more effective than sympathy.<br>
"You said it would end. You even predicted the day."<br>
"Look if you're going to be all sympathetic you can get lost now."<br>
I had said it would be over. Last Monday I told him it would only last a week. Jessica was a little hard to believe in. A beautiful stranger who turned up on my doorstep in the middle of the night. She walked into my room and briefly into my life with long red hair and skin like silk. Of course it wasn't quite like that. Not quite out of the blue; there were reasons, and chance meetings in the street. The impression was still of unearned fortune. I did predict it wouldn't work. But I didn't mean it.<br>
"I'm sorry, it's bad. How did it happen?"<br>
"She told me she wanted to break, then turned to me for sympathy. It's her old boyfriend."<br>
"Ah."<br>
I suppose he thinks she left me for her ex. That's not exactly it, but it's an explanation that's easy to grasp and I'm happy to leave the blame on the old boyfriend. It would probably be more accurate to say she went out with me in the first place because of him. The truth is I don't really care. I know I'm not upset, probably William does too, but I feel I deserve some sympathy anyway.<br>
"Well we'll stick some good records on and play them loud."<br>
William believes in music. That it can cheer you up. Teach you something. He seems to find answers in the intelligent ironic songs he feeds me. "I will not forgive you," sing the Black Crowes, "Nor will I accept the blame." I don't believe in music, but I sit and listen, letting song after song wash over me whilst my mind starts planning tomorrow. There's nothing better to do.<br>
