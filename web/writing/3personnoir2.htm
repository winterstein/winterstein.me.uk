 <h2>Scene 2: Now Make With The Investigating</h2>
HARRY: Eddy Blake, and not a scratch or broken jaw on you. Muscles you're getting good at this subtlety thing.
MUSCLES: Thanks Boss. 
HARRY: I got a job for you Eddy.
EDDY: Don't know that I'm available.
HARRY: A bit of gratitude might do wonders for your life expectancy. You may not know this but it's only my word that keeps you alive in this town.
EDDY: How's that?
HARRY: You know Red Scharlach?
EDDY: Yeah.
HARRY: So he wants to take out a contract on you. Something to do with putting in brother away.
EDDY: How much am I worth?
HARRY: Ten large.
EDDY: I'm flattered. If he'll made it 15 I'll do the job myself.
HARRY: So the reason you haven't given up breathing yet is that I vetoed any such action in my territory.
EDDY: You almost restore my faith in humanity.
HARRY: Fuck you, what do I care if you live or die? Except that you do it in my turf, and I ain't having Red Scharlach calling in hit jobs in my turf without going through the proper channels. But this puts you in my debt, & so you best make with the co-operation.
EDDY: Give me fifty bucks and tell me your problems.
HARRY: I have a number shuffler by the name of Yiddish Mack.
EDDY: Yiddish Mack.
HARRY: Marcel Yarmolinsky to the proper authorities, being only the morgue now. Someone offed him last night.
EDDY: How?
HARRY: Ventilated with a knife.
EDDY: Where'd it happen?
HARRY: You know the Windsor Hotel?
EDDY: Expensive pile of bricks over on east side. Any witnesses?
HARRY: One. The night porter caught a glimpse of the perp as he fled.
EDDY: So you've got a description. Can't your boys handle this?
HARRY: Sure. They already shot the perp in 3 places.
EDDY: Yeah? So why'd you send the extra large without manners round my place?
HARRY: They shot the perp in 3 different alleys in 3 different parts of town. And he denied it each time. So I'm thinking, what with there being so many perps in this town, maybe my boys missed.
EDDY: What's the police's angle on it?
HARRY: What've they got to do with it? Yiddish Mack was one of my boys. I sent the police home. I imagine they'll put natural causes on the certificate when they present it to his next of kin.
EDDY: Anyone with a grudge against him?
HARRY: Who'd want to ice someone else's number shuffler?
EDDY: They may lack your knack for making enemies, but not everyone loves them. Someone didn't love this one enough to oblong him.
HARRY: Which is why I hired you. To investigate. So get your PI arse over to the Windsor and make with the investigating, because I have got other shit to be doing. Muscles will help you. 
EDDY: I only work with qualified people. 
HARRY: What's that PI?
EDDY: This mobile beef mountain don't qualify as a person.
HARRY: Muscles, if he cracks wise again, break his left arm. He can still investigate with one arm. Now get lost.
