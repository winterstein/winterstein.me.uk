<li><a href=Vindication.htm>Vindication</a><br>
<i>"Before writing, his head
                had swirled with a thousand stories. Glorious tales
that would bring laughter and tears
                to the reader. Something that would reach out and, in
simple clear words, touch other
                people with the beauty of the world. Now that he had
produced a story it clearly did no
                such thing. He wished he had never written it. It was a lot easier being judged only by
                his potential." A little pretentious, a lot of flaws, but I like it anyway.</i><br><br>
