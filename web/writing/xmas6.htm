<h3>TUESDAY</h3>
<br>
DIERDRE: Don't you put me on hold! [pause, B fumes] Well?<br>
PHONE: Yes, we have someone. Joan Bakers, she'd a D grade nurse with 3 years experience.<br> 
DIERDRE: I hope she's good.<br>
PHONE: All our staff are fully trained.<br> 
DIERDRE: That last girl you sent us was useless. Hardly knew how to tie
her own shoelaces let alone administer a decubitas ulcer
re-bandaging. - and so rude.<br>
PHONE: Our nurses are completely qualified.<br> 
DIERDRE: So you say.<br>
PHONE: I assure you they are, we are a professional agency. If you have any complaints, you should make them through the proper channels.<br> 
DIERDRE: Just tell me when she'll be here.<br>
PHONE: 3 o'clock<br> 
DIERDRE: 3 o'clock!?<br>
PHONE: She says she can't get away any earlier, and I'm afraid we don't have anyone else. We're very busy this time of year.<br>
DIERDRE: 3 o'clock's no good - I need someone now.<br>
PHONE: I'm sorry, there's really nothing I can do.<br>
DIERDRE: You can give me her number, I'll have a talk to her.<br>
PHONE: 7996 4533<br>
DIERDRE: [writes down the number]<br>
PHONE: OK?<br>
DIERDRE: Good bye. [dials] Hello, is that Joan Bakers?<br>
NURSE: Yes, speaking.<br>
DIERDRE: My name is Dierdre O'Feeny from Charing Cross Hospital. I'm the senior nurse on ward 4 north.<br>
NURSE: Oh yes, I'm coming in later today.<br>
DIERDRE: That's why I'm phoning. You see, we need you here now.<br>
NURSE: I'm afraid I'm busy. I wanted to take today off entirely.<br>
DIERDRE: Well, it's your business, but this is important.<br>
NURSE: It's my son's birthday.<br>
DIERDRE: I can understand that, I'm an aunt myself. But the ward's
understaffed, and I wouldn't want to be responsible if anything
happenned to one of the patients.<br>
NURSE: I can't miss his birthday completely. It's bad enough having to
do one shift.<br>
DIERDRE: Is he having a party?<br>
NURSE: Yes, he's five.<br>
DIERDRE: Then there'll be other adults there who can look after him?<br>
NURSE: Well yes, but...<br>
DIERDRE: Mrs Bakers, we have some very sick people here. More than I can
look after by myself.<br>
NURSE: I... <br>
DIERDRE: It won't be my fault if they don't get proper care.<br>
NURSE: OK, I'll come in. I'll be there at 12. I hope you don't need me
to administer a decubitas ulcer re-bandaging. I'm not very good at that.<br>
DIERDRE: [puts phones down] Uh, really - you can't even get an agency nurse these days.<br>
<br>
[DIERDRE enters with the breakfast trays, hands one to ALEX]<br>
ALEX: Where's Margaret? Doesn't she normally bring the meals?<br>
DIERDRE: Margaret! She phoned in sick.<br>
ALEX: Is she alright?<br>
DIERDRE: She's fine - it's me that's suffering. She could have phoned last night, but no. And now the replacement 
nurse won't be here until midday, so I get her work on top of my own. <br>
JEFFREY: My piles bleed for you.<br>
DIERDRE: [looks at him furiously]<br>
JEFFREY: But you do it with such good grace. And so efficiently - breakfast served by 11:30.<br>
DIERDRE: Shut it. Today is bad enough without you starting.<br>
JEFFREY: Sorry. Remember, my dear, I am an in-patient.<br>
DIERDRE: [puts J's tray down roughly]<br>
JEFFREY: What no reply?<br>
DIERDRE: How could I possibly compete with your wit?<br>
JEFFREY: Well that's what I presumed.<br>
DIERDRE: You! [searches for a non-swearword] You only think of yourself. All the time, the only person you care 
about is you and how you're feeling. Well I guess that's because there is no-one else to care about you. No visitors, no friends.
I'm probably about the only person who even remembers you exist.<br>
[JEFFREY is silent]<br>
DIERDRE: What no witty reply? [pause] Nothing but an old pest. An incontinent old pest who shits in his bed which
I have to clean.[exits]<br>
JEFFREY: She got me Andrew. Holed below the waterline.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>
DR: [enters] How are you feeling?<br>
ALEX: Fine. Healthy.<br>
DR: OK, you're discharged. Get the nurse to bring your clothes and you can go home. We hope you have enjoyed 
your stay here and look forward to seeing you again. [smiles &amp; exits]<br>
[clock forward. ALEX takes off hospital robe.]<br>
<br>
[<i>play slowly and awkwardly</i>]<br>
ALEX: Right. Take care. Hope you get better soon.<br>
JEFFREY: Thank you. Give my love to the world.<br>
ALEX: I'll...<br>
JEFFREY: No you won't. But thank you for the intention. Although I prefer chocolates to 
intentions, if only for the taste. But don't worry about me.<br>
ALEX: Well now I'll have to visit, to prove you wrong.<br>
JEFFREY: Good bye.<br>
ALEX: Au revoir.<br>
[ALEX exits]<br>
JEFFREY: [nods]<br>
[lights down]<br>
<br>
[lights up. JEFF (looking bored) &amp; ComaBoy are in bed]<br>
DIERDRE: [enters left] Lights out in 1 minute [exits left]<br>
[pause. ward lights are switched off (ie. lights dim)]<br>
JEFFREY: [hums/der-ders The Last Post]<br>
[lights down. projection, TV style, one line at a time]<br>
since this was writtecn:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex and Margaret have started dating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret has quit nursing and now works as a bailiff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dierdre is still at Charing Cross Hospital.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey died 5 months later.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conscious the whole time.<br>
