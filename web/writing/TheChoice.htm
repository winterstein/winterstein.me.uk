&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, without fuss, the knight died. The battle was already decided by then, and in his side's favour. It is well known that dying men will often hold on, somehow, to see their loved ones one last time. In a similar way, the knight had kept fighting long after the sword thrust that wounded him so, and now around him lay the lifeless bodies of a full five of the enemy. Finally, he had slowly sunk to the ground. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the light had faded from his vision, he'd seen a grim armoured figure approach. So it is ended, he'd thought, and soon I shall see death's kingdom where god willing my wife awaits me. He'd pictured her in his mind then, as he liked to remember her, in the full blossom of her youth. She used to go riding at dawn, and come back as he woke, her hair tied back elegantly but her eyes flashing with rude health. It was nine years now since she'd passed away, but time had done little to dull the pain.<br>
The figure above him lifted it's visor.<br>
"Good sir knight, you are wounded."<br>
Death, the knight had realised, would not make such asinine comments; only the living do that. With his remaining strength he had raised his own visor and replied "Yes, it's the old war wound acting up. Always happens this time of year."<br>
The other man had ignored this. Sir Bedemere took this as a sign of the man's good nature, but really his head was so empty that, inspite of entering his ears, the comment had completely missed his brain.<br>
"Sir Bedemere of Kent?" the man had inquired, extending his hand, "Sir Peregrine of Essex, we met last Christmas I believe, at the Royal Mass."<br>
Sir Bedemere had closed his eyes. The mental image of his dear Sarah was replaced by the memory of an annoying bore who had cornered him at one of the interchangeable court parties. There was at least one pest like Peregrine in every gathering, with a set of opinions handed down from generation to generation. Inbred twits who considered boasting about the amount of beer and number of servant girls they got through to be the height of wit. Blood, it is said, is thicker than water. Peregrine's parents were blood relatives, and their son was indeed thick.<br>
"No - I tell a lie, it was at the Duke of Norfolk's banquet in November - splendid chap the duke - but we simply must get you to a doctor. Can you walk?"<br>
Sir Bedemere had realised then, with a feeling approaching joy, that since he was dying, he no longer had to be polite to anyone. For the first time in a long time, he'd felt free, and it had given him new strength.<br>
"I'm dying you inbred idiot," he'd said. Which was a little hypocritical, considering that his own parents were cousins, and nothing to be ashamed of anyway. His whole anger, in fact, was perhaps unjustified. Although Peregrine and Bedemere would never have been close, had they met under different circumstances they might have got on well enough. Bleeding to death from a stomach wound is not how one would choose to die, not unless the choices were truly poor, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Bedemere's sudden intense hatred for Peregrine was inspired more by the agonies of his death than a real character evaluation.<br>
"See that hole in my chest? Yes, the one with the blood coming out. Do you think to cure that with leeches? Christ! Was your brain removed at birth, or did it just shrivel up from lack of use? To think I leave the kingdom in hands such as yours... Now listen carefully, for these are my last words and I want you to carry them to my son:"<br>
"No need to get angry with me." Sir Peregrine had said, his feathers ruffled, but this was a fellow knight's last wish so he'd let the insult slide. "Now what was it you were saying?" he had asked, but there was no answer for Sir Bedemere had gone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Peregrine, the battlefield, and the pain of his wound all faded away. As they faded out, a new figure faded in. The knight's vision was completely black now, yet he could clearly see death's figure as a deeper darkness against the blackness. It had the distinct form of a man in a cowl.<br>
"Sir Bedemere." Death said. Or rather, the words were suddenly there; they did not seem to have come from anywhere.<br>
Sir Bedemere stood up. "Yes." he replied, or rather agreed; it hadn't been a question.<br>
Death seemed to nod. A light appeared above them. Pale and white, it was not strong enough to sparkle on Bedemere's armour. He could now see the bottom part of Death's skeleton face. A bony jaw extended slightly into the light. The rest of Death was hidden by his cowl, which was not made of any earthly material. Black beyond worldly black, absorbing all light that touched it and reflecting none. It had a clear shape, but without substance. The knight sensed rather than saw Death's arm move. A bony hand rummaged in the cowl and, to his surprise, produced a clipboard which was thrust at him.<br>
"Sign here." Death said without moving his jaw.<br>
He took the clipboard in one hand. A quill dangled from the board on a piece of string, but he could not hold it properly with his metal gauntlets on. Holding the clipboard to his chest he pulled the right one off and dropped it. It fell away into the void beneath them, growing smaller and smaller until it could no longer be seen. Taking the quill, he looked at the clipboard. The scroll on it seemed to shimmer, as if in the heat, but it felt like normal parchment. It was a list of names. Though most of them were unfamiliar - indeed many were written in scripts that were strange and foreign to him - Bedemere recognised some of them as knights involved in the battle. There were names of both friends and foe here. He shook his head sadly; there were some good men on the list.<br>
"Ah, Sir Galwain, and Richard Earl of Northumberland," he sighed, "The land will not see your like again."<br>
The signatures varied from studied elegant handwriting, to those who just signed with an illiterate cross. Bedemere added his own in a rough but readable hand.<br>
"This way." said Death, taking back the clipboard. With it's other hand the skeleton reached out and pulled on the surrounding darkness. Although they appeared to be in a vacuum, a section of it swung open like a door. Bright light shone out from the opening, too bright for Bedemere to make out what was on the other side. He stepped through.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side turned out to be a tastefully decorated waiting room. Rich tapestries depicting bible stories hung on the walls. Beautiful blue stained glass windows let in light that was soft, clear, and somehow white. In front of him stood three supernatural beings. The closest was a tall spindly demon in a pinstripe suit. Bedemere could tell he was a demon because his skin was mottled red and black, and he had a small pair of horns. He didn't recognise the pinstripe suit as such, of course, but it was. Living outside of normal time and space, demons' clothes often seem strange to those who meet them. There are those who hearken back to the old days (plus some imps who are into the whole retro thing) and go without clothes and carry a pitchfork. The legal division however, to which this demon belonged, has always adopted sensible suits and always will. Some other things which Bedemere didn't know, but which are included here for the purposes of a streamlined narrative, were that the demon was named Nigel, and had the job of informing newly-deads of their crimes and the resulting judgement. He had been demoted to this from the much more prestigious post of corrupting the living when, due to a typographical error - which had to have been a set-up, no doubt that bastard Mandrake from accounting was behind it - he bought half of a man's shoe. (If, dear reader, this sort of bald-faced abandonment of the rules of writing offends you, let us say that the knowledge dropped into Bedemere's mind like a cold stone) Behind this demon stood a pair epitomising the stereotyped images of an angel and a demon.<br>
"Nigel?" said Bedemere, "What kind of a name is that for a demon?" but in the interests of narrative clarity his comment was ignored.<br>
"Bedemere, Henry of Kent." Nigel intoned, "You are hereby condemned to eternity in hell.", somehow making it sound like a parking ticket.<br>
"Any hope of time off for good behaviour?" Bedemere asked.<br>
"None at all. However... well, let's say yours is an unusual case. I'll explain more later."<br>
"What am I condemned for?"<br>
"Used to like the old raping and pillaging didn't you sir? There was that time in Dunny-on-the-Wold for instance when you were 13..."<br>
"I was young," Bedemere said ashamed, "But I confessed and was absolved."<br>
"Yes, yes - it's down here, 10 hail marys and a gift of 20 acres to the church. All perfectly legitimate. I just thought you might like to reminisce a little. People often get nostalgic at this point."<br>
"I repeat," the knight repeated, "What am I condemned for?"<br>
"Taking the Lord's name in vain, sir. If you recall you said 'Christ! Was your brain removed at birth, or did it just shrivel up from lack of use?' to," the demon checked it's notes, "a Sir Peregrine, just before dying."<br>
"Eternal damnation for that? Jesus!"<br>
"You're only making it worse for yourself now. Taking the Lord's name in vain, sir, is one of the cardinal sins. However, as I said earlier, yours is an unusual case. Heaven has made a special request, and we have reached a deal whereby you are to be given a chance at reprieve. Calm down please, it's quite simple. This room you've been brought to has two doors. One leads to heaven and one to hell. You have been allowed to choose your door. Now, if you will excuse me, I must be going. Someone in Hampshire has just said 'Of course I cooked the pork properly'."<br>
With that, the tall demon vanished.<br>
<br>
Sir Bedemere now took the time to study the room carefully. The doors Nigel had spoken of were in the far wall, one white on the left, the other black. Next to the white door stood the other, shorter, demon, whilst the angel stood next to the black door. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctively, Bedemere stepped towards the angel to talk.<br>
"Which is the correct door?" he asked.<br>
"The white one." replied the angel.<br>
"Black!" said the demon, who had also heard the question.<br>
Bedemere turned his back on the demon. As he did so, he noticed that the marble around the angel's feet had been carved. A pentagram had been cut into the stone, and around this was a circle of black writing in arcane symbols he could not read.<br>
"What is this?" he asked.<br>
"It is a pentagram of truth. He who stands inside it must always tell the truth." the angel replied.<br>
"He's lieing!" yelled the demon, who Bedemere now noticed was standing within a pentagram of his own.<br>
The angel gestured to something behind the knight. Caught as he had been in the strange proceedings, it had not occurred to Bedemere to examine the wall behind him. He did so now. He was not altogether surprised to find the door he'd entered by had since disappeared. In its place was a sign painted on the wall:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One door to heaven and one to hell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make thy choice and make it well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two gatekeepers may guide thy way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bound by powerful magic ties<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One to always tell thee lies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One to always truthful be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge carefully what they say<br>
<br>
He turned back to the two beings.<br>
"So which is the door to heaven?"<br>
"White" "Black"<br>
"And which is the door to hell?"<br>
"Black" "White"<br>
"And who is lieing?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is."<br>
<br>
He tried a different tack. "Can you tell me..."<br>
Here he paused, leaned closer to the angel, and extended a finger towards the nearest window. It was a truly exquisite piece of glass work. Stained glass cut not into a picture, but along lines senuous like brushstrokes, and all blue. The different shades ran from delicate sky blue colours to the richest blues with seams of turquoise and dark navy blue flowing through. The window seemed to define, project and proclaim blue. It would have been utterly useless as a device for letting light in or seeing through.<br>
"...what colour this window is?" <br>
"I couldn't say." the angel replied, "We can only answer questions about the doors."<br>
A liar and a truthteller - equal and opposite, symmetrical halves making a diametrical whole. Without an outside point of reference, there really was no difference between the two. As it was as if they existed just as counterparts of each other. Every question he asked received all possible answers, which was the same as no answer at all.<br>
Unless - here an idea occurred to the knight - unless the two could be combined with a question. What is the sum of a lie and the truth...<br>
With a crafty look in his eye, he spun on the demon. Strength and purpose seemed to shine out from his armour.<br>
"What would he say if I asked him whether the white door led to heaven?" the knight demanded.<br>
The demon rolled this round in its mind for a minute.<br>
It replied in a slow voice; "No."<br>
Bedemere rolled this round in his mind for a minute.<br>
His thoughts went back to the first time he'd met Sarah. It had been at one of the many interchangeable court functions. Heralds had announced the arrival of His Grace, the Prince of Wales, and everyone had lined up in the courtyard to greet the prince. The prince's carriage pulled in, a footman opened the door, and his highness had stepped out, resplendent in a coat of purple silk, a shirt bearing his royal crest, and his breeches wide open. Only Sarah had laughed, although a full two dozen nobles must have been close enough to have noticed. It was her laugh caught Bedemere's attention. Then when they were introduced, she had smiled and he was lost.<br>
He tried to recall what the occasion had been, but it was an elusive memory, one of the ones that one has to sneak up on, and ambush from a neighbouring memory loyal to your cause. He let it go; it didn't matter. He stepped towards the white door.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the handle, he stepped through into a lift. The demon followed him in and closed first the door, then the metal lift grill. <br>
"Going down I'm afraid sir." The creature said as the lift lurched to a start. It dropped rapidly, the temperature increasing as they descended. It took Bedemere's mind a little time to catch up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going to hell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd misunderstood; made the wrong choice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today really wasn't going well at all.<br>
"So you were telling the truth then."<br>
The demon giggled and looked away. It tried to stifle a full blown laugh but failed, "No sir, I'm not meant to tell you this, but I can't keep a straight face. We were both lying." <br>
"But the sign - and the pentagrams -"<br>
"You see," the demon explained, "When it said one of us would always lie and one tell the truth, well - it was lying sir."<br>
It doubled up with fresh laughter and had to lean against the wall for support.<br>
"A pentagram of truth? Really sir."<br>
"So the black door led to heaven?"<br>
"Oh no sir, they both go to hell, that's just our little joke. Terribly dull job being a doorkeeper, but the management do their best to lighten it up. You know I once had that Sir Lancelot in here..."<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month later, the new Sir Bedemere, still mourning the loss of his father, chanced upon Sir Peregrine at Court. Inevitably, the conversation turned to the previous Sir Bedemere.<br>
"I was with your father when he died." the older knight told him.<br>
"How - how did he die?"<br>
"Valiantly." Peregrine answered, "He fought bravely; asked no quarter and gave none. I found him just before his wound overpowered him. Many of the enemy lay dead around him, and I do not doubt that the man who wounded him paid for it with his life."<br>
"Did - did he say anything before he died?"<br>
Here Sir Peregrine dropped his head and looked at the floor. He didn't know quite how to say this. It really was a most unpleasant spot to put a chap in, to hurt the poor lad's feelings like this. He'd been putting it off, but a knight's dying wish couldn't be ignored.<br>
"Yes, but I think he was raving. He was in a lot of pain, you understand, and had lost a lot of blood. I don't think he knew a hawk from a handsaw anymore, if you know what I mean. He asked me to tell you... well..."<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"Well, to give you a telling off I suppose. The last thing he asked was for someone to carry these words to you, 'Was your brain removed at birth, or did it just shrivel up from lack of use? To think I leave the kingdom in hands such as yours.' He said that, and said to me, 'You carry these words to my son.' "<br>
Peregrine shrugged, as if to say, who can understand what men think at such times.<br>
