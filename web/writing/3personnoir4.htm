 <h2>Scene 4: Another Bad Case of Assasination</h2>
[MUSCLES enters]
EDDY: Please tell me you're not a Kiss-a-gram.
[HARRY enters]
HARRY: There's been another killing. A Shylock by name of Ben the Rabbi caught the sharp end of a bullet.
EDDY: Another one of yours?
HARRY: Yeah. And guess what? Another note.
MUSCLES: 'The second letter of the name has been uttered'
HARRY: So tell me PI, why is someone knocking off my Jews? Is this some kind of war?
EDDY: I think these are ritual murders, committed by a cult.
HARRY: An anti-semitic cult?
EDDY: Like Christianity? No, I think this was the work of a Jewish cult.
HARRY: A Jewish cult.
EDDY: Yeah.  Seems Yarmolinsky was into it some strange stuff. He was
a cabalist on the side, and a big fish in those circles.
 Cabalism
is Jewish black magic. It involves searching for hidden meanings in
sacred texts, You could think of them as spells, except they use a bit
more literature and mathematics than your average witch.
HARRY: No shit. He kept that one quiet.
EDDY: He was trying to find the Tetragammaton - the name of god.
HARRY: God is called god.
EDDY: That's just our name for god. Jewish tradition ascribes 99 names to God. Cabbalists believe this is an imperfect number, and that it points to a missing name. This would be God's name for god, and carries immense power. They call it the secret name.
HARRY: Fascinating as this shit is, it don't explain why two of my employees are suffering from a bad case of assassination. Do you know who killed them yet?
EDDY: I don't know who, but I might know why. They weren't killed. They were sacrificed.
HARRY: Sacrificed?
EDDY: In the distant past, cabalists have performed human sacrifices as part of their rituals and experiments. And the tetragammaton is the ultimate prize. If an extreme cabalistic sect were sure enough of what they were doing - they would kill to get it.
HARRY: Enough. All I need to know are names and addresses.
MUSCLES: You believe any of that Jewish voodoo?
EDDY: They believe it, and that's what matters. My job is the same regardless.
MUSCLES: Yeah but do you?
EDDY: I believe as little as possible. The path of wisdom is cautious, we reason, we gather evidence, explore and extrapolate, conjecture and question. Always keeping an open mind. Which is to say, remaining uncertain on a great many things. It is not wise to be too certain.
MUSCLES: You think too much PI.
EDDY: I think too much for a living.
