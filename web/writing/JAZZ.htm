CLOSE UP ON JAZZ:
The Charlie Hunter Quartet at The Borderline, London 8th July

        I can report this gig without fear of contradiction. Hardly anyone was there, so if I say Charlie Hunter flew, then he flew. He is one of the hottest of the new generation of Jazz players. In the USA that is. No-one's heard of him here. Whilst fellow Boston student Joshua Redland is playing to 1000s at the Barbican, Charlie Hunter's sole England gig was criminally underattended. Only 50 people turned up to the small dimly lit club. Charlie came on to check the leads before the gig and no-one recognised him.
        Hopefully he'll forgive us, because his band are one of the best things to happen to jazz for a while. Charlie plays an 8-string; a mythical creature, half bass, half guitar. He looks something like an American compski for the first 5 minutes. Then you realise that he is in fact a jazz-funk deity, and the beard is just god dressing in mysterious ways. With him is a drummer and two (2) saxophonists. If you haven't heard an inspired tenor and alto sax duet, you won't understand why this is such a good thing, but try to imagine.
        After the first song he introduces the crusty old amp he's been given as a special guest and starts talking to it: "Which key do you want to play in then? OK, the rest of us can do that key." Meanwhile the tenor sax is using sign language, trying to persuade the sound engineer to increase his share of the volume. None of the audience can spot any problems in the sound however. Towards the end, the alto saxophonist is playing with his eyes clenched shut, rising up on his toes as if the music would lift him up. Which was not entirely unreasonable. Charlie lets loose with a ten minute guitar solo that has everyone up and moving with the music, except those who go into shock and start dribbling.
        It was a unique gig. Those who came got to hear some of the best musicians around playing just a metre or two in front of them. Afterwards some of us went backstage to find the band in shock at the lack of available drugs. The club had generously provided mineral water only: "Mineral water? We're a jazz band. We need joints!" Sadly all we could do was console them.

They have several albums out, but if you like the funkier side of jazz at all, well, you should have been there with Charlie and me.
