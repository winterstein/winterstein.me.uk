<title>And love is... Excert from Baal by Bertolt Brecht</title>
<body>

You have to have teeth for it, then love is like biting
into an orange, with the juice squirting into your teeth.
<p>
And love is like putting your naked arm into a pond and letting it float with the weeds between your fingers, like the pain in which the drunken tree groans and sings as the wild wind rides it, like drowning in
wine on a hot day, her body surging like a cool wine into every crease of your skin, limbs soft as plants in the wind, and the weight of the collision to which you yield is like flying against a storm, and her body
tumbles over you like cool pebbles.
