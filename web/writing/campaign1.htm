 <h2>Scene 1: The Office</h2>
[A short sharp burst of jazz, then lights up on a large office - though by no means the largest. The furnishings are modern and stylishly functional. There is one big desk in the room and BENWAY is seated behind it. JOHN is standing.]
JOHN: What the fuck? What kind of a piece of shit is this? 
[JOHN is a junior account handler in his early 30s. Right now he is angry and on edge, but most of the time he has an easy-going extrovert manner. However he is never quite at ease. Insecurity leaks out of him in little ways: a flicker of uncertainty, the occasional nervous gaze, etc.]
BENWAY: What do you mean?
[In his mid 40s, BENWAY should be in the prime of his career. In fact, he is close to burning out. He is the most secure and powerful of the characters, but he's by no means invulnerable, and you're only as good as your last campaign.]
JOHN: Is this your way of telling me I'm out, that you give me such a dumb-shit dead-ass pile of fucking excrement?
BENWAY: It's a good project.
JOHN: Good project? Yeah, and your mother's a good fuck. It stinks.
BENWAY: Better my mama than my sister, & my sister's not bad.
JOHN: Don't piss around with me Benway. You know I'm hot, you know I can deliver the goods. So why are you trying to get rid of me, assigning me to this fucking worthless project?
BENWAY: It's got a budget of [writes a number on a piece of paper and slides it across the desk for JOHN to see] It's a good project.
JOHN: That's a big number.
BENWAY: One of the biggest.
JOHN: I didn't know numbers went that high.
BENWAY: It's a good project.
JOHN: You're right it's a good project. 
BENWAY: Of course I'm right.
JOHN: I'd like to thank you for giving me the chance to work on such a fine project.
BENWAY: I believe you'll deliver the goods.
JOHN: [sits down] I'm sorry if I seemed less than grateful earlier.
BENWAY: That's OK.
JOHN: I thought maybe what with the promotion you didn't remember your old friends anymore.
BENWAY: Hey; you can trust me. We go back. But John.
JOHN: [apprehensive, but hiding it] What?
BENWAY: Lately, well...
JOHN: I know, I know. It's been a bit of a bad patch, but don't worry. I can still deliver. 
BENWAY: I'll make sure you do.
JOHN: Don't I know it. So what do we get?
BENWAY: Depends. The company has a cut. Once that filters down - well whoever comes up with the ideas is going to do pretty well.
JOHN: Pretty well?
BENWAY: Very well.
JOHN: The usual rules?
BENWAY: You mean excellent pay plus truly fucking outrageous bonuses?
JOHN: How outrageous?
BENWAY: Downright offensive. Retire to a mountain of cocaine in the home counties type bonuses. Come up with the goods, your bank manager will give you his pretty little 15 year old daughter on the house.
JOHN: Thanks for giving this to me.
BENWAY: Hey, you've earned it.
JOHN: I have, I know. But thank you anyway.
BENWAY: Ah shut up.
JOHN: Because I know you didn't have to. You could have taken on a few green-horns, and taken all the glory.
BENWAY: This is true. Don't forget it.
JOHN: What's the team?
BENWAY: I'm in charge. Yourself of course, and I reckon we bring in one more person for the core team.
JOHN: Who?
BENWAY: Well there's Rory.
JOHN: No way. I know he's got an OK reputation, but it's all his own hot air.
BENWAY: Yeah?
JOHN: Yeah. There's less to him than meets the eye. The only talent that tosser has is for taking the credit on other people's work.
BENWAY: That would count against the fucker. 
JOHN: What about Dante?
BENWAY: Nervous breakdown, hadn't you heard?
JOHN: No
BENWAY: The deodorant campaign.
JOHN: But that was a beautiful campaign. He had every young male in the land parroting that catch-phrase. It was fucking mind control.
BENWAY: Maybe that's what got to him. I don't know.
JOHN: It's a tough fucking business. Not everyone can take it.
BENWAY: This is true. Especially with this kind of money at stake. 
JOHN: I can feel it pushing down on me now. 
BENWAY: Can you take the pressure?
JOHN: Does the pope shit in the woods? You and me Benway, we're like those deep sea fish.
BENWAY: You mean the really grotesque ones?
JOHN: Yeah but the point of the analogy was not that you're butt-ugly - though you are. <!-- - nor that we use phosphorescent bait to lure unsuspecting victims right into our sharp jaws. BENWAY: Don't you? JOHN: Well yes, you can't beat a good flashing light for the luring of unsuspecting victims. But --> No, the point I was trying to make was about pressure. Those fish need that the pressure. Us too, it's our natural environment. It's the weight on our shoulders that keeps us down to earth.
BENWAY: It certainly ain't the cocaine.
JOHN: Returning to the matter in hand, how about Sarah?
BENWAY: Sarah Armstrong?
JOHN: Yeah. Smart girl, good to work with.
BENWAY: I hadn't noticed. I'm generally too busy staring at her tits.
JOHN: Trust me, she's good. The kind of person who can't break some eggs without making an omelette. And she's ambitious, but not yet confident. That makes her hungry for success.
BENWAY: Hungry. Hungry is good. [pause] Let's have a look at her then. [intercom button] Reception? It's Benway. Get hold of Miss Armstrong for me. Tell her to come to my office ASAP. [to JOHN] Just keep your relationship on a professional basis.
JOHN: What, you want me to charge her for sex? My days as a pro are over.
BENWAY: What are you doing in advertising then? You're fired.
JOHN: OK, I'm a whore, I'm a whore.
BENWAY: Good - and as your pimp I advise you charge more than you're worth.
JOHN: We do have to cover the cost of the condoms.
[offstage] SARAH: [knocks] Mr Benway?
BENWAY: Come in.
[Enter SARAH. She is 20 something, and conscious of being the youngest of the three, or rather, of having the most to prove. Right now though she is simply excited and enthusiastic.]
BENWAY: Sarah Armstrong. 
SARAH: Yes.
BENWAY: Have a seat. [she sits down] I am Mr Benway, I believe you already know John Hamilton.
SARAH: I know who you are too sir.
BENWAY: You've got a good record Sarah.
SARAH: Thank you.
BENWAY: And John tells me good things about you. Now, there's a contract we're bidding for. An important one. I'm considering you for the team.
SARAH: Oh Mr Benway, I would love to work with you. I really admire your work.
BENWAY: Please, call me Benway.
SARAH: I studied you at college. Not your ads so much as your holistic approach to a campaign. Your use of cross-promotional tie-ins was pioneering. This is an honour for me.
BENWAY: I know. But you didn't like the ads themselves?
SARAH: Oh of course I did. That ad for double strength coffee.
BENWAY: Recaffeinated coffee.
SARAH: Yes, with the doctors using it to resuscitate a patient, shot like an ER scene on steroids. It was great. And your ad for that ridiculous energy drink.
BENWAY: You mean Kickapoo Joy Juice. Sweet fizzy water with the added goodness of tartrazine.
SARAH: 8 out of 10 doctors couldn't care less, but we paid the other two to say:
SARAH & JOHN: This stuff rocks.
BENWAY: Cue screaming guitars, fade out to a hefty hike in market share. Thank you very much. Was that my bonus in his pocket or was the client glad to see me?
JOHN: Fuck, another dew-eyed youngster who thinks the sun shines out of your arse.
BENWAY: Sure it does. That's how your nose gets such a nice tan. 
JOHN: Mr Pot calling Mr kettle black.
BENWAY: Blacker than a moonless midnight. Sarah, what are you working on right now?
SARAH: I was on the ketchup account. But with that finished, I've only got some odds and ends which I could clean up in less than a day.
BENWAY: That's the correct answer. Now the only question is, why should I pick you?
SARAH: Because I'm talented. I can do it, and I can do it well. I think my work speaks for itself there. But so far I haven't had the space to really stretch my wings. This would be an opportunity for me to show what I can really do. You can be assured I would give my all to your project.
BENWAY: Hmm. If you could step outside for a minute.
[she leaves]
JOHN: What do you think?
BENWAY: Oh we take her. [JOHN rises] Sit down; let her stew a little. [JOHN sits down] We don't want to look easy.
JOHN: You're a hard man.
BENWAY: Hard but rich. <!-- mean/meaner than average --> 
[pause]
JOHN: About now?
BENWAY: Yeah, that should do.
JOHN: [goes to the door] Sarah? Come in.
[SARAH enters. JOHN returns to his seat]
BENWAY: I've decided to give you a shot. Welcome onto the team.
SARAH: Thank you. 
BENWAY: Don't thank me; you're going to have to work fucking hard. [pause] You don't have to do it standing up though.
[she takes a seat]
SARAH: Er, What is the project?
BENWAY: It's...
JOHN: We're selling slippers.
BENWAY: Yes.
SARAH: Slippers?
JOHN: Expensive brand name slippers.
SARAH: OK.
JOHN: I know it's not the most glamorous contract we have, but...
BENWAY: Pull this off and we'll be heroes. Our praises sung.
JOHN: Our deeds told in song.
BENWAY: And unlike other heroes, we'll be rich too.
SARAH: I didn't say a word.
BENWAY: By the way, we're not the only agency involved.
JOHN: Who else?
BENWAY: Goldberg Associates. They're also after this contract. 
SARAH: So we both develop a sales concept, and the client picks the winner.
BENWAY: No: we both develop a sales concept, and the client picks us. The way we make that happen is this: Firstly we've got to beat those suckers to the punch: get our idea in first, sell it hard and sell it well. Secondly: we've got to be better than them.
JOHN: Don't worry.
BENWAY: There is another factor to bear in mind. The client mentioned that they get a lot of their production done in the third world in conditions that, might best be kept quiet.
JOHN: What are we talking about?     SARAH: What... kind of conditions?
BENWAY: They didn't say. They were just highlighting a concern about potential bad publicity. So far they've not been targeted. But it is a factor, especially since our campaign is going to raise their profile somewhat.
JOHN: They're putting their head above the parapet.
BENWAY: Exactly. So our campaign has to be un-bustable. And it has to be so cool, it wins the generation x-ers over.
JOHN: Anything else we should know before putting our brilliant brains to work?
BENWAY: Yeah, your flies are undone.
JOHN: My loins need the ventilation.
BENWAY: I often have that effect on people. OK team, let's take a break. Reconvene in ten.
SARAH: OK.
BENWAY: Sarah, although you are the junior team-member, I'm going to entrust you with an important job.
JOHN: Watch out girl, he's about to shit on you from a great height.
SARAH: I'm up to whatever the job takes.
BENWAY: I want you to bring me a coffee.
JOHN: Oh dear - that's one risky job. Benway is a coffee purist.
BENWAY: I prefer to think of myself as a `coffee fascist'.
SARAH: [deep breath] I hope you realise I am not some little woman who'll do your menial tasks. I am a strong and independent person and I am only doing this to suck up to you.
BENWAY: Black. No sugar. I'm sweet enough already.
