 <h2>Scene 2: The Office</h2>
[BENWAY's office 10 minutes later. BENWAY, JOHN and SARAH are all seated. BENWAY has a coffee. SARAH is the outsider here and is endearingly uncertain of herself. JOHN and BENWAY are not aware of excluding her.]
BENWAY: Firstly let's decide on our target demographic?
JOHN: So I think we should be going for several different types of people. 
BENWAY: There are six billion different types of people last time I counted. Which ones were you thinking of?
JOHN: There may be six billion different types of people, but only eight demographic groups. And if that's not very precise, well it is often easier to change the market - that is change the consumers to meet the product. 
BENWAY: Yes, I know. We are currently in the age of carpet-bombing. The next stage though will be accurately targeted advertising. Statistically guided marketing that zeroes in precisely on individual consumers. But I'm day-dreaming. Let's focus on who will buy our slippers. John?
JOHN: Well we should go after a cross-section of classes, rich to poor.
BENWAY: So we pitch it as a quality product.
JOHN: But worn by people who are cool rather than particularly rich. We go for teenagers to middle-age. So we pitch it at 20 year olds, because everyone wants to be 20.
BENWAY: I have trained you well. Sarah, any thoughts?
SARAH: [slight pause; she wants to impress but can't think of anything to add] I agree. What do we know about the product?
BENWAY: Well, there's a box of samples over there. Help yourself.
SARAH: I'm thinking, is there anything that makes it special. Something that we can turn into a unique selling point.
JOHN: A revolutionary special fabric that makes them warmer.
SARAH: Is that true?
BENWAY: It could be. 
SARAH: Sorry?
BENWAY: The truth is whatever we say it is. Not that we lie; you don't have to lie. We imply. We suggest. We use the power of imagery.
JOHN: Though the real world can be a good source of inspiration.
BENWAY: True. But this is all irrelevant. This is not that kind of brand, or that sort of product. It's no good convincing the proles our slippers are the best; they're still not going to buy them and certainly not at top dollar. We need to sell them a style of life, an image, that they'll be willing to pay for. So forget the product itself, focus on the brand. What we're selling is sex, youth, freedom, love, friendship, all that is good and slippers. They buy the slippers as a down payment on the rest.
JOHN: Of course we also want them to think the product is top quality.
BENWAY: The high price will convince them of that.
SARAH: What mediums are we using?
BENWAY: Anything and everything. The core will be a TV campaign, but with lots of support. I'm looking at saturation coverage. Our target audience won't be able to take a shit without seeing our advertising. They will live and breathe it until they can't remember a time when it wasn't part of them.
JOHN: What about sponsorship?
BENWAY: What about it?
JOHN: I say `hell yes'. Celebrity endorsements.
BENWAY: OK Who?
SARAH: How about Bagpuss? [she looks to JOHN for a smile of support]
[Note: I don't know how if an American audience would know Bagpuss. If not, Bert & Ernie would be a suitable replacement.]
JOHN: Dear Bagpuss, Old fat furry cat-puss...
SARAH: Yeah, he's got that laid back feel that'd be just right for slippers.
JOHN: Hell he practically is a slipper. Slightly alternative yet widely liked. Evokes nostalgia in the 20 somethings and above.
BENWAY: [to JOHN] Yes Bagpuss works for me too. No wait, he's BBC.
SARAH: So?
BENWAY: BBC are fuckers for licensing. Keep a tight rein on their brands.
JOHN: Going for a different image: The Beckhams.
BENWAY: In slippers? We're not that rich. Don't get hung up on just celebrities though. I want us to be everywhere. Sponsoring sports clubs, music. 
JOHN: Yes, I'm thinking acoustic performances.
SARAH: Yes. Nice and cosy. 
BENWAY: See if you can get a liqueur company interested in going halves. Also comedy, community projects - get 'em young. Remember, TV time is expensive. Celebrities are expensive. But people are cheap. [checks his watch] I have another meeting. [BENWAY exits]
JOHN: [now giving her his attention] How are you finding your first day of the big time?
SARAH: It's a little intimidating.
JOHN: Of course.
SARAH: But nothing I can't handle.
JOHN: A tough girl.
SARAH: A professional.
JOHN: Of course. I wouldn't have recommended you for the job otherwise.
SARAH: You did?
JOHN: Well yes, Benway asked me who'd be good.
SARAH: Thank you. [light jokey tone] I'll remember it when I make partner.
JOHN: [friendly sarcasm] Partner?
SARAH: [sarcastically naive] You know, like they recently made Benway.
JOHN: Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?
SARAH: I intend to be up there with the best.
JOHN: I guess you've got to think big.
SARAH: [slight pause] Does it bother you that thing about... 
JOHN: About?
SARAH: About the client and the sweatshop thing.
JOHN: [shrugs] They're all the same these companies. Anyway, it's not our business really. We don't have anything to do with that.
SARAH: [looks doubtful]
JOHN: You're not having second thoughts about the job are you?
SARAH: No, not at all.
JOHN: Good. It's a fucking good opportunity, you know?
SARAH: I know. Tell me, who else did you consider?
JOHN: Well, we thought of Dante.
SARAH: [she is impressed at the idea of having been chosen above Dante] Dante Contreras?
JOHN: Yes, but he's taking a leave of absence to spend more time with his psychiatrist. Then Benway suggested Rory.
SARAH: Hah! I mean, he's competent but hardly... you know.
JOHN: What?
SARAH: Hasn't got any real creative zip or pzaz.
JOHN: At the risk of talking jargon, he's a tosser. 
[SARAH laughs]
JOHN: So I said, No; let's give the lovely Miss Armstrong a chance.
[SARAH smiles at him]
JOHN: Benway'll be back soon. Let's sell some slippers.
SARAH: You know Benway well?
JOHN: Yes, he's like the abusive father I never had.
SARAH: But his bark is worse than his bite...
JOHN: Dunno. [smiles] In Benway's case, underneath the hard exterior, there's a pretty hard heart. Don't get me wrong; he's good friend. But... [shrugs]
SARAH: He is quite demanding, isn't he? Quite intense.
JOHN: You think he's demanding now? Just wait.
