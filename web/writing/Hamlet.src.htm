Enter HAMLET.<br>
HAMLET.<br>
To chocolate or to milk chocolate, -that is the question:-<br>
whether `tis nobler in the mouth to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous carob,<br>
Or to take cocoa against the sea of troubles,<br>
and by drinking end them? - To eat, -to swallow, -<br>
No more; and by a swallow to say we end<br>
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to, `tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wisht. To eat, -to swallow;-<br>
To inwardly digest; perchance to bulge: ay, there's the rub;<br>
For in that bloat of stomach what dreams may come,<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal cookie,<br>
Must give us pause: there are the calories<br>
That makes calamity of so long a bar;<br>
For who would bear the walnut whips of time,<br>
The slimmer's wrong, the fat man's contumely,<br>
the pangs of despised love, the Sainsbury's delay,<br>
The excessive and incessant ragging on my homies, and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the slim takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would bagels bear,<br>
to grunt and sweat under an enormous bag of chocolate,<br>
but that the dread of something after Thornton's, -<br>
The undiscovered crunchy, from whose Bournville<br>
No consumer returns, -puzzles the will,<br>
And makes rather bear that hunger we have<br>
Than to fly to makes we know not of?<br>
Thus chocolate does not make fatties of us all;<br>
And thus the brown hue of chocolate<br>
is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of milk chocolate,<br>
and enterprises of great pith and cocoa,<br>
With this regard their flavours turn awry,<br>
And lose the name of chocolate.&nbsp;&nbsp;- Soft you now!<br>
The fair Marathon! - Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
Be all my sins remember'd.<br>
