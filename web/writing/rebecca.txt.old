<i>Things were so much simpler in the old days when you just had to hit `em over the head and drag `em back to your cave.</i><br><br>

<br>
I'm just going to write this down. You always said I should just write. You do it fine - write sprawling letters of your day to day doings, as easy as talking. I would rather do this as sculpture than writing. A girl and a boy, carved out of black marble. Her, rising from bed to join him at the window, clothed in moonlight and grace. She is beautiful; somewhere between a kitten, playful and young, and a goddess: fiery and exciting, but also faithful and true. He is very lucky and he knows it and he shows it by making her world light up and shine. My words are not nearly good enough to capture it; are poor as tourist shop souvenirs; it needs a Rodin to carve it. The real thing would be beautiful though.<br>
<br>
That was then and this is now. "I want to break up" you say. I know this can't have been easy to say. It isn't easy to hear either.<br>
<br>
It was not unexpected though. You'd wrestled with it for some time. I'd feared it for some time.<br>

<br>
You called me down to Manchester, then practically ignored me when I
was there. So I was rude and sulked. And I couldn't like your
friends. They didn't care about me and I couldn't keep from thinking
on which you'd be sleeping with, and how soon and how cheaply they'd
treat you, and how you'd probably be happy anyway being part of the
scene. And I couldn't like the scene, not when it threatened to take
you from me and remake you all shallow as a sexy piece of plastic. So
I cared only for myself. I thought your love should make you notice,
make you understand. Thought that I should have the right to be
selfish occasionally. And I should! But love is a fragile thing and
cannot withstand people's rights. I moped, and was angry when you let
me mope. Took a perverse catalogue of the distances between
us. "Perhaps, my diary says, I have become her insignificant other."
<br>

A serious omen.<br>
<br>
The summer holiday, such as it was, was worse. You say you kept rearranging your plans for me. You should have said. I guess you just wanted a definite plan, but I thought that you resented the claim I had on your time; resented the time away from Manchester. Uncharitable morbid thoughts. And good ideas had too late: you should have worked the festival. How sweet that could have been, but neither of us thought of it. Or maybe things were already too out of shape.<br>
<br>
July in London: You flinch when I touch you. We are lying side by side in my bed. I run my hand down your side, and your body twitches ever so slightly. I know you'll deny it if I mention it. Nevertheless it is there, and it is followed by lying impassive, which is worse. Now the bed feels squalid.<br>
<br>
How that hurt! And I thought of all the languorous mornings we had had. We had such pure motives, and such impure actions. Clothes strewn across bedroom floors. Caresses and kisses as free as the air. Sex so natural I would lose track of where I ended and you began. Such easy beauty.<br>
<br>
 - There's something I should tell you. I'm bisexual.<br>
I think I took that one pretty well:<br>
 - You're not to sleep with my sisters<br>
 - I don't want to<br>
 - What's wrong with my sisters?<br>
And we laughed, which was a relief to both of us. But I was left saddened by the episode, because it meant you were regretting not having `experimented'. Which meant you were thinking seriously of sleeping with other people. Which you spelt out soon enough anyway. Old jokes come back to haunt me. When people asked after you, I used to reply that you were having far too much fun in Manchester.<br>
<br>
Old jokes:<br>
 - I love you.<br>
 - You're wrong, but I'm happy to take advantage of you.<br>
 - I love you.<br>
 - You have no taste. How can I go out with a girl with such taste?<br>
 - I love you.<br>
 - You're deluded. - You're just saying that to scare me away. - You'll grow out of it.<br>
Cheap lousy replies which were just another way of saying I love you too. Which is what I said in the end; you had more love than I had jokes.<br>
<br>
Paris: I don't want to think about Paris. Such a sad time. We tried to disguise it, to hide behind nice wines and good food, but we never really escaped from the oppressive sadness that bour down on you. For the love of god, smile, I thought. For the god of love smile! Smile and it might - might - save us. But you couldn't, didn't. It was too painful for you, and me the cause of your pain! Sad streets, and the lovely youth hostel which should have been a dream like a honeymoon suite. A double bed and a balcony in Paris, Romantic dream! what more could we want? And the double bed used mainly for sleeping, and we felt it the worse for the place being so nice. Your eyeliner smudged into black tears. Frozen silhouettes cast on your face. <br>
<br>
How different from Cromer. I got my addresses muddled and sent you to the wrong campsite and my train was delayed. It didn't matter. You were there waiting at the station. The wrong campsite turned out to be nicer by far. That was a very British holiday. All chips and walking by the coast. Seas too cold to really swim in (though we had to try), and a tent for two. You had your new camera with the sniper rifle zoom. I had your old one, and took some lovely black and white photos. You look peaceful and relaxed in them, if a little out of focus. <br>
<br>
How different from Venice. Where I got angry and upset, I don't know why, except that I was tired. You had the patience to cheer me up, and we had a great time. Making love in a double bed in a mountain town, and your tent pitched by the heart shaped lake that was really kidney shaped but who cares, heart shaped would have been tacky.<br>
<br>
No flowers the entire summer. It just occurred to me. No flowers for either of us, and I remember: Coming home to a room full of flowers, wall to wall daisies. It was so cool; flowers in style. Sneaking a bunch of flowers into your room (I think I got Eleanor to do it). Or a carved wooden flower I hope you still have, that seemed such a sweet thing. And a dozen red roses, now dried, from an earlier goodbye.<br>
<br>
Though there are other explanations, I keep returning to the tightrope walking metaphor. The long distance was possible only as long as you didn't look down. <br>
<br>
During the day we were miserable but at nights it was torture. You: unable to be happy, and I always knew the things you weren't saying. I was just struggling to find a way through. But all my wonderful abilities were of no use, were as cheap junk.<br>
Lying in bed battered and emotionally exhausted.<br>
"Timm says hello"<br>
We laughed, and for something like a second we were cured. Suddenly I am not sure if this was in Edinburgh or Cambridge, it doesn't matter. This summer took on a blurred overlong quality. Stretched out, distorted. In short this summer was a nightmare. I was lost in the middle of a desperate fight and you couldn't find how to push through.<br>
<br>
I'm avoiding music at the moment. Song lyrics have been sounding real poignant and that's always a bad sign.<br>
<br>
The thing was, we could still laugh naturally, relax with each other, do stuff: go to a play, eat a meal, enjoy ourselves. Because when you forgot about it, we had a good time. That weekend in Edinburgh was actually a nice weekend. We had fun, and I think it was genuine, that it was not the manic or forced fun that people have when they desperately don't want to think about things. And I wonder if maybe the existence or possibility of problems was the greatest problem. That if only the clouds could be banished, they would not return. Irrelevant! Something changed in you, something was lost, and that there is no getting around.<br>
<br>
And our love was magical, and as such I am unable to explain why once it was so strong and now it is gone. Nor know whether it is the beginning or the end which needs more explaining. Treacherous magic that can run out on a summer's day, without warning or reason. <br>
<br>
I thought you'd got through. When I met you at the station with a pizza and a beer it was going to be the start of a golden period of laughter and warm smiles and excitement and friends and booze and sex. Like a seed rising, I was ready for a new beginning. You too; but one without me. "I want to break up." I dreamt that an endless stream of relatives I'd never met before prevented my efforts to talk to you. I woke up and everything was still screwed. Sometimes dreams aren't so hard to interpret.<br>
<br>
Arthur's Seat is a lousy mountain by day, too full of tourists and couples. <br>
<br>
You laugh when I give you a chocolate frog (lime flavoured Belgian white chocolate). It's absurd and pathetic and therefore escapes the stain of (of our failed love) and lets us escape too, for a moment. You play with a plastic gun. You laugh again. You say something on a subject other than US. I wish I could join you. Wish we could have a happy inconsequential weekend. I cannot - and my heart is too bleak to pretend for your sake.<br>
 - Where did you go?<br>
 - To the mountains<br>
 - How are you?<br>
 - Do you want me to lie?<br>
 - No.<br>
 - I love you. I need you. I thought we'd be together forever.<br>
The strange dignity of the chocolate frogs was lost and I put us back where we were when I left. You nodded sadly. It seemed this weekend your repertoire of reactions had become a sad nod, a slow flinch, and turning your eyes down and away. Horrible arguments going in circles, going nowhere. Endlessly repeated.<br>
<br>
You say "I don't know how to touch you". It feels self serving: you no longer want to touch me. It hurts to write that, but it's true. Which is not reason enough to write it. I would like to write only of the golden moments. Your face when I turned up in Manchester out of the blue. Or you aflame fighting Sandy on an ugly night in Clems 7. But no lies, no half truths. We're not good enough liars to cover up the warts. Let us throw stones at each other! Slamming doors are better than unreturned phone calls and fading memories. Fire is better than drizzle. And no Phoenix ever rose from the drizzle.<br>
<br>
You go for a shower and I hunt around for something to wipe my eyes and blow my nose on. I spy a tissue in a pile of papers and pull it out. It turns out not to be a tissue but an old serviette from some forgotten café. There is a quick drawing of some flowers in black biro and a message in a soft elegant hand "for my Dan forever from Rebecca x".<br>
<br>
"I didn't know how to help you. I felt so lonely; you shut me out" you say, "And it hurt that I still don't understand you." I thought I'd practically spelt it out. Far more so than was proper. Some things should not be explained. Explaining changes things, can make them impossible to cure. Now the course is over though, the time has passed, the battle lost. So here goes.<br>
The sun burns hydrogen in vast amounts. When the sun runs out of hydrogen it will start to burn helium instead. In as much as it makes sense to use such language about a star, at this point it will begin to die. Burning helium has dire consequences: the sun will become bloated, will wipe out the earth, will start to cool. And in as much as it makes sense to use such language about a star, the sun has no choice - without hydrogen it must burn helium or immediately implode.<br>
Your muscles burn oxygen and glucose, When there is no oxygen, they make do without, but they make lactic acid as a consequence. Which builds up, which hurts.<br>
The body burns carbohydrate and fat. When there is none, it burns protein instead. Dissolving muscles and organs to keep going.<br>
So I needed you to get me through. Needed your love, needed to know you'd be there when I finished. But you weren't there. So - in order not to implode - I burned other fuels &amp; I don't know what the side effects will be. I doubt they will be good. I always assumed that if I needed your help, you'd give it. That when I was strong and supportive it was just a case of from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs. That you would be there for me.<br>
<br><i>
When I needed a friend were you there? Were you there?<br>
When I needed a friend were you there?<br>
&amp; the wind and the rain and the cold don't matter<br>
Were you there?<br>
<br>
I was tired, I was lonely were you there? Were you there?<br>
I was tired, I was lonely were you there?<br>
&amp; the wind and the rain and the cold don't matter<br>
Were you there?<br>
<br></i>
When there's no firewood, the books and the furniture must go. What I burned to get through was my love.<br>
I turned the framed picture of you face down so I wouldn't have to see it, removed the ring you gave me because I couldn't bear to wear it. Cursed your name five times a day facing towards Manchester. And yet I love you still and would have forgiven you completely if you could only have said "I love you" in the tender way you used to, or kissed me. But you couldn't, can't. What was once as easy as breathing has become impossible.<br>
<br>
You were my sun, my wellspring. I used to wake up missing you, missing your presence in bed, and your warm smooth skin. And yet be filled with hope and energy, because you were out there. You were something I hadn't believed in. A rock, steadfast and true. I watched you grow, gaining confidence. Though you never got the confidence to share your work with me when I wanted to be your muse, to be able to say look at this piece, she did that for me. I was stupidly proud of you, you must have known. It made me wince when you were petty or bitchy, because it was so out of character, so not you. I was filled with pride at your strength and your successes. My personal hippy angel, all flawed and shot through with needs and desires. In the world you deserve, you would shine like a beacon and never know it. Where did I lose you? Were your needs so immediate? Was the sordid glamour of Manchester too enticing? Was my life in Edinburgh too squalid, too desperate?<br>
<br>
Were we apart too long? Sad nights! Only half lived. Each bar or mountain picnic or good joke I made a note to revisit with you. And now there is so much we will not do. Or thought, Rebecca would like this, pictured how you would smile. Or thought, Rebecca would see through this, would laugh and say something sarcastic. I dealt with it using some form of doublethink. Compartmentalised; it's a man thing to do. To switch bits of ourselves on and off as appropriate. You - I guess you dealt with it by burning love. And I didn't work that out until now. I'm so sorry my love. I had idealised you as my angel Rebecca; didn't realise that your love had a limit.<br>
<br>
Where now is the love that was implicit in every kiss? That could eclipse the night. That burned so strong for three beautiful years. I could weep all day for the memory of how beautiful we were. But what tears should I cry? What difference would they make? I cry anyway; I can't help it.<br>
<br>
Manchester v Edinburgh. I saw it as just a choice of where to live, but you worried it would end up as a choice of who gets to live. You or me: which of us gets to be ourselves, and which is subsumed, swallowed up. <br>
<br>
Should love not be more important than such things? Is it love if it isn't? Love will not blind us to the compromises, but there should be the joys of love to counterbalance them. Is it love if it isn't? Perhaps. I think one can love, and love truly, and know it is a mistake and you must leave the one you love.<br>
<br>
We stand outside the station having just missed the train. Not knowing how to say goodbye. <br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=20 cols=2><tr><td>
What now? The next time we meet it will be just the same. It's not going to change. How can it? There's no future for us. And I am stuck unhappy and wasting my student days for something that's going to fail. Long distance relationships don't work. I thought we were different, but I was wrong. I should have been stronger. Shouldn't have given in and stayed. It will only be harder now. I need to start fresh; this is only making me miserable. But I can't bear to leave him like this.
</td><td>
If only she would smile. If only I could make her smile. She is thinking of the future. If only she could ignore the future, take her happiness in the here and now. How can we have a happy forever if we can't be happy now? Oh for the times when I could make her happy with a kiss or a few words. Now a kiss would only depress her, would be rebuffed. How shall I make her smile when she is in such a dark lonely mood? I can't bear to leave her like this.</td>
</tr></table>

<br>
Cold and tearful. Unable to give me a glimmer of hope or light or warmth. We part badly. Cold as frogs in winter. Oh sad pathetic day! The lonely walk back through streets full of strangers to a flat that isn't home. And you: sitting in the station, trying to read, waiting painful hours for the train. Did you make it home without crying? Oh my love, forgive me! I want you to be happy, but I could not let you go.<br>
<br>
We are bound together by happy memories and shared passion. We are bound by intangible emotions. We are bound in chains of fucking iron forged in the furnace of the heart. We are bound to hurt each other when we separate. I can hardly bear to write the word. I have to attempt to be strong, find some reverse alchemy to turn the gold of love to the silver of friendship. I think you need to move on, I think I need to let you. At the end of the day… At the end of the day, the day is over. Time to pick up the pieces and go on.<br>
<br>
Everything ends badly. None of us pass through life without leaving a trail of tears behind. Our own and others. It's the snail slime that sticks us together. What magic was it, to turn love into despair? An everyday miracle too terrible to behold. Yes, everything ends badly. Happiness is only ever on loan, and joy is a delicate transitory thing existing only for the moment, and what is true is true only for one time and one place, and all the rest of that shit. And I wrote this not from the heart but from the gut; you get bile as well as blood. Yet just as I could not walk away from you, nor you from me, I cannot finish the letter like this. It is too melancholy, and it is not how things were.<br>
<br>
In my photo album we hold each other and grin in black and white. <br>
<br>
Or further back, to a bright eyed girl in a Cambridge pub and neither of us had a clue.<br>
<br>
And I remember forgotten times. Unimportant moments when we were together. A walk down by a creek under trees. A boy and a girl talk of idle and forgettable things. The day is sunny. He is just twenty, she seventeen. The world is opening up for both of them, and it will be sunny walks and soft kisses and hot kisses and late nights and wine and art and ideas and such beautiful glorious action and it will never end. They stop beneath a spreading tree. <br>
He hardly knows her yet. She is an opening mystery by his side. She moves with elegance and grace. Acts with passion. So pure and true. A perfect beauty of a girl. A sweet natural eye to the world. Woke up and alive, all excited in the great flow of life. Rejoice! For such beauty was-is real, Rejoice! He lies back, and she lies with him. Kisses his face gently. He gazes up and his world is covered in canopies of green leaves and falling brown hair.<br><br>
