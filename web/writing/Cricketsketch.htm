And you join us at Lords for the first ever England-Iraq test match.<br>
Yes interest has been phenomenal following the change in regulations replacing the traditional red ball with the standard issue Russian hand grenade. A controversial decision?<br>
Perhaps, some people might say so. In fact I believe Amnesty International are protesting outside the grounds today.<br>
And of course play was called off yesterday because of ball tampering when it was discovered someone had disarmed the balls. One of the more radical anti-cricket groups is claiming responsibility.<br>
However the regulations body has stuck to its decision, they say it will make the game more exciting and broaden its appeal. I think we'll just have to wait and see whether the differences justify the bloodshed.<br>
Ah, the captains are stepping up for the toss. The sweat is standing out on English captain Michael Atherton's forehead.<br>
Yes he's definitely trembling.<br>
Of course, this is a matter of life and death.<br>
He's calling heads... its tails! The Iraqi fans are cheering. One of the English team has fainted on the field.<br>
Yes, that's Phil Tuffnell.<br>
That's going to count against them. He'll be a sitting duck when the game starts.<br>
First over.<br>
The Iraqi captain batting first. Here comes the ball... its a good shot, going out towards the boundary. Fraser is running away from the catch...will he make it? He's leaped over the boundary that should protect him.<br>
(BOOM)<br>
Marvellous play.<br>
Next ball,... Oh, its a long shot. The crowd are going wild, they're trying to escape....<br>
(BOOM)<br>
England switching bowlers, Croft now, looks like he's trying a slow ball.<br>
Yes, he's holding it, looking the Iraqi captain in the eye.<br>
That's Colonel Arafat, a veteran of the Gulf War, indicted for crimes against humanity and ungentlemanly cricket, wanted in three countries and not wanted in most others, a hard man by all accounts.<br>
Here comes the ball now.<br>
And the Colonel has broken! He's dropped his bat, running from the crease.<br>
There goes the wicket! (BOOM) and the rest of the stumps.<br>
This could be the break England need. Iraq has called this the `mother of all cricket slaughters', but their cricket technology just isn't up to England's standard.<br>
Of course they are fielding the Elite Republican Cricket Squad<br>
Next ball, a great shot, its arcing up, its<br>
It's coming our way. Run!<br>
Stand your ground! The BBC expects every man to do his duty.<br>
(stand and salute)<br>
I'm afraid we have to leave you now, but our replacements will be back bringing you ball by ball coverage of this historic game.
