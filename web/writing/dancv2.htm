I have been modest and honest, but not at the same time.<br>
<br>
I have walked on five continents and swum in the Med, the Red, the
Dead and the Arabian Seas, the Atlantic, the Pacific and the
Thames.<br>
<br>
Swum with water snakes, in piranha infested waters, got lost in the
woods at night in leopard country, been bitten by mosquitoes when
there was a malaria outbreak, hit by a car, almost drowned, eaten my
own cooking and the only time I ever went to hospital was when I
didn't break my elbow.<br>
<br>
Canoed on the Amazon, gone white water rafting in the Himalayas, hiked
across a desert and up mountains, galloped down dried up river beds,
surfed, skied, wind surfed, jet skied, scuba dived, snorkelled,
fenced, rowed, rock climbed, abseiled, pot holed, flown a glider and
crashed a hovercraft.<br>

Cycled, canal boated, been uncomfortable on camels, hitchhiked, ridden
a baggage carousel, slept on crowded trains luggage chained to the
seat, rode on the roof of a bus with Radiohead playing on the tape
recorder and the sun setting on the mountains, and been caught
speeding (80mph in a 30 zone) but was let off.<br>
<br>
I've been to opera, Tibetan opera, Thai dancing, London clubs, a New
York jazz club, listened to Tibetan folk music, Indian music, rock,
blues, goth, indie and liked it all, but refuse to admit that DJ
Shadow is any good.<br>
<br>

I walked though Paris at night with a beautiful girl and a bottle and
we danced in the fountains of the Louvre.<br>
<br>
I played the guitar to thousands (2) in a monastery in the foothills of the Himalayas.<br>
<br>
(but this was all just time and space, not me)<br>
<br>

Written student drama and stand-up comedy. Published poetry, sold art and
filmed a nude scene.<br>
<br>

Drunk cocktails and fine wine and moonshine and am not ashamed to
drink cider.<br>
<br>

Eaten in a maharajah's palace and flimsy dirt huts, a dozen Pizza
Expresses, take away chinese on Venice Beach, a revolving restaurant
overlooking San Francisco, and over camp fires and over candles. Eaten
piranha I myself caught and it did not taste like chicken. But I
legally became an adult without having tasted porridge and have never
eaten quiche.<br>

<br>
I have done Israeli dancing, Tibetan dancing, ballroom dancing and
disco dancing and been crap at all of them though I once won an award
for choreography.<br>
<br>
I have gambled and had lessons in cheating from a professional card
sharp.<br>
<br>
I have broken into my home four times, nicking a ladder and climbing
across the roof once in pyjamas and slippers.<br>
<br>
Been lost so many times and so easily that I have come to believe I am
permanently lost.<br>
<br>
Planted two trees, a garden and a pot plant. Kept cats, goldfish (bad
combination) terrapins, a puppy, two sisters, raised frogs and had an
injured tortoise that eventually went into hibernation and never woke
up.<br>
<br>
I am, apparently, a threat to Indian national security, and have been accused of being a fascist. College reports describe me as "a bit of a coughdrop".<br>
<br>
I can cook perfect brownies without a recipe or an oven, say "I am a small cabbage" in five languages and know all the words to Hotel California. I hold three nationalities and have family in two more countries.<br>
<br>
I do know the meaning of the word fear. But I don't know the meaning of the word recondite.<br>
<br>
I have been bored, but never for long.<br> 
I have not yet drunk enough
champagne, but then some things are impossible. I am currently at
university studying life, whist reading mathematics, but where the
river of time will take sweep me from here I do not know. I aim simply
to carve out a happy world for those I love, and then see if I can't
flog it to the Japanese.
