 <h2>Scene 5: The Office</h2>
[A conference room, the next day (Friday). BENWAY and JOHN are seated]
BENWAY: Monkey see, monkey like.
JOHN: Cheers.
[SARAH enters]
SARAH: Morning. Hello, you're here early.
BENWAY: John's had an idea for the campaign - a good one. Tell her.
JOHN: So this is the TV ad: A young and beautiful couple at home. They're having a glass of wine. Studio flat, stylish but homely. She's wearing the slippers - house shoes. They smile at each other - it's a sexual smile - they head for the bed. She slips off her house shoes; graceful and very sexy. Perhaps a shot of her from behind: her perfect  back as her blouse falls away. And I don't think this girl wears a bra when she's at home. Blouse flutters down to land by the house shoes. Then we have him. He's wearing boots, he's trying to take them off, but what with all the hormones and pheromones flying round, he makes a mess of it. Lots of haste, not much speed.
BENWAY: What do you think?
SARAH: It sounds awfully familiar.
JOHN: Slogan, maybe: `get comfortable'.
BENWAY: What do you mean?
SARAH: You thieving bastard. That's my idea Mr Benway. It's mine. You -
JOHN: What are you talking about?
SARAH: Don't act innocent. It's my idea - I told him that idea yesterday.
JOHN: No you fucking didn't.
BENWAY: Why didn't you tell it to me?
SARAH: It was after work.
BENWAY: This is a serious accusation Sarah.
SARAH: It's the truth.
BENWAY: John?
JOHN: I have no idea what this bitch is on about. I've never stolen an idea in my life.
BENWAY: Did you meet up after work?
JOHN: Yeah.
BENWAY: Did you talk about the campaign?
JOHN: No.
SARAH: He's lying.
JOHN: You're delirious.
BENWAY: Quiet. [pause] Sarah - Have you got any evidence to back this up?
SARAH: er... wait, yes I have. I wrote it down last night. It's here in black and white in my folder.
BENWAY: Show me.
SARAH: [searching frantically] It's - it's not here. Shit, I - I swear it was here. That arsehole must have pinched it.
[pause]
BENWAY: That arsehole is a friend of mine.
SARAH: You don't believe me? 
BENWAY: John and I go back. You, I hardly know. You're young but you're not innocent. And you don't have any evidence. So no, I don't believe you.
JOHN: There's the door girl - don't let it hit you on your way out.
SARAH: There's the window arsehole - don't let the blinds hit you on your way down.
BENWAY: Enough. This is my theory: Sarah, you probably had the germ of an idea. Maybe it was the germ of this idea. You said a few vague things. The germ was planted and flowered in John's mind. Now you say 'this is my idea'. But it ain't. You probably said some offhand thing, John produces the goods - and you think what he's done is the obvious development of what you said.
SARAH: That's not it at all. This is my idea. I had the whole fucking idea. I had the entire advert. Except for the slogan - which I might say, sucks.
BENWAY: Look, I've had that feeling before. But I know it for what it is, which is self-serving bullshit. Now I've worked with John for years. You're just a little girl. But your ambitious and greedy or you wouldn't be here. So you're giving yourself the benefit of too much doubt, and trying to take some credit that isn't really yours.
SARAH: I swear to you -
BENWAY: Don't. All that means is that you've convinced yourself. That's a captive and not very critical audience.
JOHN: What do we do now?
BENWAY: What do you mean?
JOHN: I don't see how she can stay on after this.
BENWAY: I'm going to think about this before I make any rash decisions. [JOHN starts to object] Uh - It's my call & I'm not making it yet. For now, we carry on as before. Act like you're grown-ups for fucks sake. Sarah go home. You've got the rest of the day off to cool your head. 
SARAH: This isn't fair. <!-- BENWAY: No? Tomorrow I expect to see some work from you.  SARAH: You've already seen some. -->
BENWAY: I'll see you tomorrow.
[SARAH exits]
JOHN: I can't believe she tried to pull that shit. I can't believe it.
BENWAY: An ugly business.
JOHN: Yeah. Fuckin' hell. Fucking unbelievable.
BENWAY: Christ John, why did you have to sleep with her?
JOHN: It was...
BENWAY: I ask you to stay away from one girl.
JOHN: How did you know we'd...?
BENWAY: Been intimate like rabbits? It was obvious. It was bloody obvious.
JOHN: I got carried away. It was a mistake.
BENWAY: No shit.
JOHN: It won't happen again.
BENWAY: [laughing] No fucking shit.
JOHN: You know we did talk about the project. Maybe she said more than I realised.
BENWAY: Maybe nothing. You want to go for a drink?
JOHN: Now?
BENWAY: Over an early lunch.
JOHN: Sure. OK.
BENWAY: Good. By the power vested in me I hereby cancel the rest of today.
JOHN: An ugly business.
BENWAY: Yeah.
