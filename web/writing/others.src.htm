<li> <a href=../ftp/bickerstaff.txt>The Bickerstaff-Partridge Papers - Jonathan Swift et al</a><br>

<i>Pretending to be a French astrologer (Isaac Bickerstaff), Swift
predicted the death of an odious English atrologer (Partridge), and
followed this up by proclaiming Partridge's death on the appointed day. The
hapless Partridge tried to argue that he was still alive. A
literary duel ensued, which Swift and his friends convincingly won. In
a scene remeniscent of something from Catch 22, Partridge found
himself struck off the Printer's Guild register for being dead;
 his protests to the contrary were in vain.
