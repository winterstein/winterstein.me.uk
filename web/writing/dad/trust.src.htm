When there is no trust<br>
You are cut adrift<br>
With no compass to guide you<br>
But fear<br>
Which fuels the imagination<br>
And brings to life the most terrifying visions<br>
<br>
What is imagined soon seeps into what is believed to be<br>
And what is believed to be points the way to what must be done<br>
What must be done becomes the only course of action possible<br>
Under the circumstances<br>
It is necessary for survival<br>
It has now become inevitable<br>
<br>
<!--
And once the fear is made action<br>
A cycle is begun<br>
Which feeds on itself<br>
Like a fire feeding on oxygen<br>
Until the oxygen is exhausted<br>
Or there is nothing left to be consumed<br>
