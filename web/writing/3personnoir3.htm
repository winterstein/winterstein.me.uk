 <h2>Scene 3: The First Letter of The Name</h2>
EDDY: How'd you say he died?
MUSCLES: By mistake. He had the room next to the hysterical broad
EDDY: Mrs Morris from out of New York. tobacco money and lots of it.
MUSCLES: Yeah. Rubies like grapefruits. That's what the attacker was after, but he screwed up and broke into the wrong room. He disturbs Yarmolinsky, and kills him to escape.
EDDY: It may not be as straightforward as it looks. There was a loaded typewriter on the desk. The paper blank except for one sentence.
MUSCLES: I didn't notice that. What'd it say?
EDDY: 'The first letter of the name has been written.'
MUSCLES: What does that mean?
EDDY: I don't know yet.
[JOURNO enters, takes a flash photo of the room]
MUSCLES: Who the fuck are you? [somewhat aggresively]
JOURNO: Hey let go, I'm just a newspaperman.
MUSCLES: We didn't order no media coverage.
EDDY: Just a second. Who do you work for?
JOURNO: I'm a reporter for the Yiddische Zeitung.
EDDY: So you'd know who's who in the Jewish community.
JOURNO: I can tell a Goldberg from a Goldstein.
EDDY: So tell me about Marcel Yarmolinsky.
JOURNO: He trained as a rabbi originally. A bright spark at the Yeshiva, but no-one likes to talk about him now.
EDDY: Why not?
JOURNO: His research isn't considered to be kosher.
EDDY: Research? What kind of research did he do?
JOURNO: Cabala.
EDDY: That's like black magic right?
JOURNO: No, no it's occult certainly, and most rabbi's don't approve
of it, but it's just another way of interpreting the scriptures, only
looking for hidden meanings. The idea is that since the torah is the
word of God, and God is omniscient, then any patterns in the torah were put there by him.
EDDY: What sort of patterns?
JOURNO: Ciphers, numerical codes, but that shit is over my head. And I don't want to know about it either. You understand even a part of it, it'll drive you insane.
MUSCLES: A mystic number shuffler, huh?
EDDY: This is one of his book's right? 'Tetragammatron: A Symmetrical Maze'
JOURNO: Guess so.
EDDY: Found on that desk. You know what it's about?
JOURNO: The Tetragammatron is the secret name of god. You want to know more than that and you're talking to the wrong reporter. Until recently I was covering weddings.
JOURNO: You're the investigating officer?
EDDY: You could say that. Eddy Blake, PI.
JOURNO: So who killed him?
EDDY: We don't know yet.
JOURNO: Do you have any leads?
EDDY: I believe the key to this mystery may lie in his own writings.
JOURNO: Yeah? That's interesting. What's the yeti's involvement?
MUSCLES: Hey. I'm just a shy guy who don't want no publicity. [picks up JOURNO] Now you can print his cockamamie shit, but you don't want to print nothing about me or my employer.
JOURNO: I didn't see you. I was never here. [exits]
EDDY: Come on Yeti. I need a drink. [exit EDDY and MUSCLES]
