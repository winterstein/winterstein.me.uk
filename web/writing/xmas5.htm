<h3>
BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY</h3>
ALEX: [voiceover] Bank Holiday Monday<br>
DIERDRE: Open your mouth.<br>
ALEX: Wha - [DIERDRE inserts thermometer, removes it &amp; moves on]<br>
ALEX: When does Margaret get on?<br>
JEFFREY: Whenever she finishes feeding 4 South.<br>
ALEX: [chuckles] You make it sound like feeding the animals at the zoo.<br>
JEFFREY: People visit zoos. 4th floor is geriatrics - you're only here because the others are full. On the 4th floor they don't walk, hardly talk and never smile. Are they really human?<br>
DIERDRE: That's a terrible thing to say. [crosses herself]<br>
JEFFREY: Is it? You wouldn't make a cup of tea for a dieing man DIERDRE O'Feeny.<br>
DIERDRE: How dare you! You -<br>
JEFFREY: Because it's true. Chambers asked for a cup of tea the day before he died.<br>
DIERDRE: Thats -<br>
JEFFREY: He did! And you said you were too busy and it wasn't your job. <br>
DIERDRE: I'm not staying to listen to this! [and she doesn't].<br>
JEFFREY: A cup of tea. Not that we knew he was dieing, or that it would have made any difference, but... People are cruel, Alexander. Myself included. People are cruel and selfish, but who else is there?<br>
<br>
[phone rings. DIERDRE enters]<br>
DIERDRE: Margaret! Where the hell were you?<br>
MARGARET: [enters] Answering a call of a different nature. [picks up phone]<br>
DIERDRE: What?<br>
MARGARET: the toilet [to phone] Good morning, 4 North, Margaret Riley speaking.<br>
DIERDRE: Don't you get smart with me.<br>
MARGARET: I'm sorry [to phone] Mrs Johnson...<br>
Sorry there's no-one
here by that name... <br>
I'll put you back to the front desk... <br>
Yes, I
understand they said so, but she was never in this ward... <br>
There's
really nothing else I can do... <br>
I understand, but shouting at me won't
help... <br>
No she's not here... <br>
Well, I'm not sure that's biologically
possible and I have no intention of trying. [hangs up]<br>
<br>
[MARGARET composes herself, brings round breakfast]<br>
MARGARET: [light &amp; good humoured] Breakfast in bed anyone?<br>
JEFFREY: [light &amp; good humoured] Do I have a choice?<br>
MARGARET: But of course, Monsieur may dine as he pleases.<br>
JEFFREY: Really?<br>
MARGARET: No.<br>
ALEX: Thank you. [sexily] Muesli.<br>
JEFFREY: Muesli again.<br>
MARGARET: Go on, it's good for you.<br>
JEFFREY: What's the point? The doctors would never believe me. Now bacon and eggs - that's a real breakfast. [tucking in with every sign of enjoyment] Sausages and fried mushrooms are good, but not absolutely essential.<br>
<br>
[DIERDRE approaches JEFF's bed]<br>
DIERDRE: Tray.<br>
JEFFREY: Please. This is a very emotional time for me: breakfast. The beginning of a new day; breaking bread, the first meal. It's a time of potential and hope, even in this place. So if you don't mind, ½ an hour?<br>
DIERDRE: No, we can't run this ward just to suit you. It's injection time.<br>
[DIERDRE takes JEFFREY's breakfast and puts it down on coma boy. JEFFREY extends an arm]<br>
DIERDRE: No, not there. [J rolls over, DIERDRE bends over him, straightens up &amp; moves on]<br>
JEFFREY: Nothing ruins a feeling of potential and hope like a rectal injection.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>
ALEX: You can't mean that!<br>
MARGARET: I never thought I'd say it, but... I still love the job. But it wears you down.<br>
ALEX: But<br>
MARGARET: I used to wake up and actually want to come in. But the pressure, the paperwork, the low pay - you get to thinking "I've served my time. I don't need this anymore."<br>
ALEX: You'd leave Jeffrey alone with DIERDRE?<br>
MARGARET: DIERDRE will stay forever<br>
JEFFREY: That old curmudgeon. I can't like her even though she doesn't want me too.<br>
ALEX: What is someone like that doing here?<br>
JEFFREY: Well she cares deeply. About the ward. Has deep proprietorial feelings, and it causes her constant pain that they allow patients into it.<br>
MARGARET: I hope that doesn't happen to me.<br>
ALEX: Never - you're too sensitive a person.<br>
JEFFREY: Ah, but DIERDRE has been a nurse far longer than you. [to ALEX] She still uses leeches you know - rank nepotism if you ask me.<br>
ALEX: [laughs]<br>
JEFFREY: What I was going to say was that she's been a nurse longer, and perhaps she's right, and we are worthless?<br>
MARGARET: Worthless Jeffrey? [laughs sweetly] Your my sweetheart; what would I do without you?<br>
JEFFREY: Oh I know, I'm the life and soul of the critical list.<br>
MARGARET: Fucking hell. My beeper. Excuse me. I bet it's that bloody greek throwing up again. [exits]<br>
JEFFREY: Perhaps once DIERDRE cared too.<br>
ALEX: What? Margaret's just a little overworked.<br>
JEFFREY: Yes, but she'll always be overworked in this system. System's
change people; if I've learnt one thing from life, it's that. You
overwork the hospital staff and of course they stop caring. Mother
Theresa never had to deal with the paperwork. Princess Diana never had
such long night shifts. You turn the GPs into accountants and naturally
they think of their own profits. System's change people, and rarely
for the better. It's fortunate the NHS attracts the caring, or it
would've already collapsed.<br>
ALEX: Curb it with the blind optimism.<br>
JEFFREY: Sorry. Margaret is lovely, and maybe she's the one in a hundred - I would take the risk - as would you, I know. <br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>

RADIO-POLITICIAN: 

The Prime Minister will soon be announcing our framework charter for standards setting out our blueprint for a new NHS.

    And make no mistake about it, these are developments the
    pioneers of our party would have been proud of. 

    Those pioneers founded the Labour Party because they wanted
    everybody to have a decent standard of living, a decent job,
    a decent home. A living wage. Clean air to breathe. Every
    child to have a good start in life, every mother to have safe
    childbirth, everybody to be cared for in old age or if they
    fell ill or had an accident. 

Their vision is our vision and we are delivering on it.

Already we are seeing a decrease in the rate of increase of waiting lists in key target areas.

The resources announced in the Budget mean real terms growth
     of 6.1% for the four years to 2003-2004, much more than
     the average net growth rate under the last Government. 

 Sick people in Britain have never had it so good.<br>
[ALEX gets up, switches radio, picks up a christmas carol]<br>
RADIO: Deck the halls with boughs of holly, tralalalala lala la la, Tis the season to be jolly, tralalalala lala la la, etc.<BR>
JEFFREY: Turn the damn thing back off.<br>
[ALEX switches radio off. clock forward]
<br>
<br>
MARGARET: [passing through] They're out of flu vaccines and a nurse short in out patients. [goes to the desk]<br>
ALEX: Out of flu vaccines? Wintertime and the hospital doesn't have flu vaccines?<br>
JEFFREY: Hah! You should have been here the time they renovated orthopaedics. That was like something from Catch 22. <br>
ALEX: Orthowhat?<br>
JEFFREY: Orthopaedics - broken bones. Anyway, must have been a couple
of months ago, they need to do some building work on the clinic -
structural repairs and so on - so they shift it to the 2nd floor of
the Nightingale <!-- Sunley --> Research Centre where there's some
space free. Except the Nightingale building doesn't have any lifts. So
they've got a clinic for people with broken legs that you can only get
to by climbing up the stairs.<br>
ALEX: Is that true?<br>
JEFFREY: Could I make that up? My boy, it's too stupid to be anything but the truth.<br>
MARGARET: Was that the orthopaedics clinic story? He's exaggerating Alex. It was just an admin error, they moved it back to the main building the next day.<br>
ALEX: How many times has he told that story then?<br>
JEFFREY: Admin error? Let me tell you another story. About my wife. [MARGARET quietly joins them] She had heart disease. They told her she needed an operation, otherwise she had 6 months left to live. She needed an operation; bypass surgery. But the waiting list was 2 years. <br>
JEFFREY: 6 months and the waiting list was 2 years.<br>
MARGARET: Oh Jeffrey, I'm so sorry.<br>
JEFFREY: Of course, if I'd had the money, the same surgeon would have done it privately the next week. That wasn't an 
administrative error. That was an administrative decision. Or a political one. &pound;100,000 they said, where was I going to find that kind of money?<br>
ALEX: What happenned?<br>
JEFFREY: She died. What in christ's name do you think happenned? She died. She died in this very hospital.
[breaks down &amp; starts to cry] I'm sorry. Whenever I think of it, the enormity hits me. My Eleanor could still 
be with me but for... How could they put her on a two year waiting list? Can you explain that to me?
<br>
ALEX: Look, I'm sorry about your wife. That's a terrible thing to happen.<br>
JEFFREY: What kind of bloody system is it that lets that happen?<br>
MARGARET: It's a good system, mostly. We do good work.<br>
JEFFREY: Not for my wife you didn't. And it's not just my wife either. How many other people have died unnecessarily? Look at it! This crumbling hospital, the pathetic pay 
Margaret here lives on, the health lack-of-service we have in this country.<br>
MARGARET: The NHS is still a good system.<br>
JEFFREY: Oh yes, we still cling to that belief for dear life, don't we? You know what I saw in the paper the
 other day? Proportionally, we spend less than anyone else in Europe!<br>
MARGARET: They promse money every budget. They just announced new cash.<br>
JEFFREY: Yes but it's mostly the cash they'd already promised. It's a magician's trick. No; a money-go-round - like a merry-go-round - they spend the same millions each time.<br>
MARGARET: We're far better than America.<br>
JEFFREY: Well woopee. I mean that's hardly impressive. Can't you see? It's falling down. And once it's gone, 
do you think they'll rebuild it? <br>
MARGARET: Modern medicine is very expensive you know. It's just not realistic to expect taxes to keep 
paying and paying - there'd be no limit. They already spend millions more each year. This hospital alone 
costs - well, millions to keep open.<br>
JEFFREY: Oh I realise that. It's my own fault for frittering my life away as a teacher. I should have been a banker - then I'd have had the money myself. She worked all her life - we both did - hadn't she earned the operation? Was her heart not worth as much as a banker's heart?<br>
ALEX: It's not that simple...<br>
JEFFREY: If I'd had a better paying job - well then I could have paid
myself, could have afforded a few little luxuries like a living wife,
wouldn't have needed society to pay - because after all there's no
such thing as society these days. I wouldn't have to be here now
either in this crummy depressing ward spending christmas with people
who also don't want to be here.<br>
No, it's not realistic to find
the money, I know that. I had to live with rationing you know - 4
eggs a week, coupon books for meat and still we had the money for
the NHS. Now the politicians just care about spinning the right
image, and the rest of you let them get away with it.  We can't bear
to see suffering. Suffering itself, we don't care about, as long as we
don't see it. Or we care, but only for 5 minutes.<br>
<!-- JEFFREY: How did we get this way? As a society. And how do we get better? Cures, as you know, are expensive.<br> -->
ALEX: Well what do you suggest then?<br>
JEFFREY: [defeated] Morphine.<br>
[lights down]<br>
