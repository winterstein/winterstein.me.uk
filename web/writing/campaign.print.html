"...if someone took it upon himself to alter the disposition of things around him, he ran the risk of losing his footing and falling to destruction, while the organisation would simply right itself by some compensating mechanism in another part of its machinery - since everything interlocked - and remain unchanged, unless, indeed, which was very probable, it became still more rigid, more vigilant, more severe, and more ruthless."<br>

from simple parts complex gigantic<br>
possibly beyond any man's proper understanding<br>
&amp; yet each part makes sense<br>

and moving if not accelerating. the final design has not yet been reached<br>
<br>
no it isn't simple, though each part is simple the whole is beyond human comprehension<br>
that is part of the problem <br>
how can there be change without understanding<br>

No-one is responsible. There are no villians <br>
Mr Jameson is as much a product of his environment <br>

no-man is so imprisoned as one who thinks himself free<br>

they are free to do what we tell them to do, dress how we decide and think what we tell them to think<br>
Nor are we any freer<br>

Sure democracy is of interest to us<br>

The Huxton Building is a prime piece of London real-estate, and the company offices take up three floors of it. Arriving at the stylish and attractive 17th floor lobby, a visitor would be greeted by one of the stylish and attractive receptionists. From there they would be led past an open plan office bustling with junior execs, creatives, and an air of youth, talent and energy. An internal lift takes the visitor up to the 18th floor, which holds a suite of well-equipped conference rooms. These two floors also hold a kitchen, a tele-marketing team, and the usual organs of any company: accountants, IT, etc. However our story opens on the haloed ground of the 19th floor.<br>

<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 1: The Office</h2><br>
[<i>A short sharp burst of jazz, then lights up on a large office - though by no means the largest. The furnishings are modern and stylishly functional. There is one big desk in the room and BENWAY is seated behind it. JOHN is standing.</i>]<br>
JOHN: What the fuck? What kind of a piece of shit is this? <br>
[<i>JOHN is a junior account handler in his early 30s. Right now he is angry and on edge, but most of the time he has an easy-going extrovert manner. However he is never quite at ease. Insecurity leaks out of him in little ways: a flicker of uncertainty, the occasional nervous gaze, etc.</i>]<br>
BENWAY: What do you mean?<br>
[<i>In his mid 40s, BENWAY should be in the prime of his career. In fact, he is close to burning out. He is the most secure and powerful of the characters, but he's by no means invulnerable, and you're only as good as your last campaign.</i>]<br>
JOHN: Is this your way of telling me I'm out, that you give me such a dumb-shit dead-ass pile of fucking excrement?<br>
BENWAY: It's a good project.<br>
JOHN: Good project? Yeah, and your mother's a good fuck. It stinks.<br>
BENWAY: Better my mama than my sister, &amp; my sister's not bad.<br>
JOHN: Don't piss around with me Benway. You know I'm hot, you know I can deliver the goods. So why are you trying to get rid of me, assigning me to this fucking worthless project?<br>
BENWAY: It's got a budget of [<i>writes a number on a piece of paper and slides it across the desk for JOHN to see</i>] It's a good project.<br>
JOHN: That's a big number.<br>
BENWAY: One of the biggest.<br>
JOHN: I didn't know numbers went that high.<br>
BENWAY: It's a good project.<br>
JOHN: You're right it's a good project. <br>
BENWAY: Of course I'm right.<br>
JOHN: I'd like to thank you for giving me the chance to work on such a fine project.<br>
BENWAY: I believe you'll deliver the goods.<br>
JOHN: [<i>sits down</i>] I'm sorry if I seemed less than grateful earlier.<br>
BENWAY: That's OK.<br>
JOHN: I thought maybe what with the promotion you didn't remember your old friends anymore.<br>
BENWAY: Hey; you can trust me. We go back. But John.<br>
JOHN: [<i>apprehensive, but hiding it</i>] What?<br>
BENWAY: Lately, well...<br>
JOHN: I know, I know. It's been a bit of a bad patch, but don't worry. I can still deliver. <br>
BENWAY: I'll make sure you do.<br>
JOHN: Don't I know it. So what do we get?<br>
BENWAY: Depends. The company has a cut. Once that filters down - well whoever comes up with the ideas is going to do pretty well.<br>
JOHN: Pretty well?<br>
BENWAY: Very well.<br>
JOHN: The usual rules?<br>
BENWAY: You mean excellent pay plus truly fucking outrageous bonuses?<br>
JOHN: How outrageous?<br>
BENWAY: Downright offensive. Retire to a mountain of cocaine in the home counties type bonuses. Come up with the goods, your bank manager will give you his pretty little 15 year old daughter on the house.<br>
JOHN: Thanks for giving this to me.<br>
BENWAY: Hey, you've earned it.<br>
JOHN: I have, I know. But thank you anyway.<br>
BENWAY: Ah shut up.<br>
JOHN: Because I know you didn't have to. You could have taken on a few green-horns, and taken all the glory.<br>
BENWAY: This is true. Don't forget it.<br>
JOHN: What's the team?<br>
BENWAY: I'm in charge. Yourself of course, and I reckon we bring in one more person for the core team.<br>
JOHN: Who?<br>
BENWAY: Well there's Rory.<br>
JOHN: No way. I know he's got an OK reputation, but it's all his own hot air.<br>
BENWAY: Yeah?<br>
JOHN: Yeah. There's less to him than meets the eye. The only talent that tosser has is for taking the credit on other people's work.<br>
BENWAY: That would count against the fucker. <br>
JOHN: What about Dante?<br>
BENWAY: Nervous breakdown, hadn't you heard?<br>
JOHN: No<br>
BENWAY: The deodorant campaign.<br>
JOHN: But that was a beautiful campaign. He had every young male in the land parroting that catch-phrase. It was fucking mind control.<br>
BENWAY: Maybe that's what got to him. I don't know.<br>
JOHN: It's a tough fucking business. Not everyone can take it.<br>
BENWAY: This is true. Especially with this kind of money at stake. <br>
JOHN: I can feel it pushing down on me now. <br>
BENWAY: Can you take the pressure?<br>
JOHN: Does the pope shit in the woods? You and me Benway, we're like those deep sea fish.<br>
BENWAY: You mean the really grotesque ones?<br>
JOHN: Yeah but the point of the analogy was not that you're butt-ugly - though you are. <!-- - nor that we use phosphorescent bait to lure unsuspecting victims right into our sharp jaws. BENWAY: Don't you? JOHN: Well yes, you can't beat a good flashing light for the luring of unsuspecting victims. But --> No, the point I was trying to make was about pressure. Those fish need that the pressure. Us too, it's our natural environment. It's the weight on our shoulders that keeps us down to earth.<br>
BENWAY: It certainly ain't the cocaine.<br>
JOHN: Returning to the matter in hand, how about Sarah?<br>
BENWAY: Sarah Armstrong?<br>
JOHN: Yeah. Smart girl, good to work with.<br>
BENWAY: I hadn't noticed. I'm generally too busy staring at her tits.<br>
JOHN: Trust me, she's good. The kind of person who can't break some eggs without making an omelette. And she's ambitious, but not yet confident. That makes her hungry for success.<br>
BENWAY: Hungry. Hungry is good. [<i>pause</i>] Let's have a look at her then. [<i>intercom button</i>] Reception? It's Benway. Get hold of Miss Armstrong for me. Tell her to come to my office ASAP. [<i>to JOHN</i>] Just keep your relationship on a professional basis.<br>
JOHN: What, you want me to charge her for sex? My days as a pro are over.<br>
BENWAY: What are you doing in advertising then? You're fired.<br>
JOHN: OK, I'm a whore, I'm a whore.<br>
BENWAY: Good - and as your pimp I advise you charge more than you're worth.<br>
JOHN: We do have to cover the cost of the condoms.<br>
[<i>offstage</i>] SARAH: [<i>knocks</i>] Mr Benway?<br>
BENWAY: Come in.<br>
[<i>Enter SARAH. She is 20 something, and conscious of being the youngest of the three, or rather, of having the most to prove. Right now though she is simply excited and enthusiastic.</i>]<br>
BENWAY: Sarah Armstrong. <br>
SARAH: Yes.<br>
BENWAY: Have a seat. [<i>she sits down</i>] I am Mr Benway, I believe you already know John Hamilton.<br>
SARAH: I know who you are too sir.<br>
BENWAY: You've got a good record Sarah.<br>
SARAH: Thank you.<br>
BENWAY: And John tells me good things about you. Now, there's a contract we're bidding for. An important one. I'm considering you for the team.<br>
SARAH: Oh Mr Benway, I would love to work with you. I really admire your work.<br>
BENWAY: Please, call me Benway.<br>
SARAH: I studied you at college. Not your ads so much as your holistic approach to a campaign. Your use of cross-promotional tie-ins was pioneering. This is an honour for me.<br>
BENWAY: I know. But you didn't like the ads themselves?<br>
SARAH: Oh of course I did. That ad for double strength coffee.<br>
BENWAY: Recaffeinated coffee.<br>
SARAH: Yes, with the doctors using it to resuscitate a patient, shot like an ER scene on steroids. It was great. And your ad for that ridiculous energy drink.<br>
BENWAY: You mean Kickapoo Joy Juice. Sweet fizzy water with the added goodness of tartrazine.<br>
SARAH: 8 out of 10 doctors couldn't care less, but we paid the other two to say:<br>
SARAH &amp; JOHN: This stuff rocks.<br>
BENWAY: Cue screaming guitars, fade out to a hefty hike in market share. Thank you very much. Was that my bonus in his pocket or was the client glad to see me?<br>
JOHN: Fuck, another dew-eyed youngster who thinks the sun shines out of your arse.<br>
BENWAY: Sure it does. That's how your nose gets such a nice tan. <br>
JOHN: Mr Pot calling Mr kettle black.<br>
BENWAY: Blacker than a moonless midnight. Sarah, what are you working on right now?<br>
SARAH: I was on the ketchup account. But with that finished, I've only got some odds and ends which I could clean up in less than a day.<br>
BENWAY: That's the correct answer. Now the only question is, why should I pick you?<br>
SARAH: Because I'm talented. I can do it, and I can do it well. I think my work speaks for itself there. But so far I haven't had the space to really stretch my wings. This would be an opportunity for me to show what I can really do. You can be assured I would give my all to your project.<br>
BENWAY: Hmm. If you could step outside for a minute.<br>
[<i>she leaves</i>]<br>
JOHN: What do you think?<br>
BENWAY: Oh we take her. [<i>JOHN rises</i>] Sit down; let her stew a little. [<i>JOHN sits down</i>] We don't want to look easy.<br>
JOHN: You're a hard man.<br>
BENWAY: Hard but rich. <!-- mean/meaner than average --> <br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
JOHN: About now?<br>
BENWAY: Yeah, that should do.<br>
JOHN: [<i>goes to the door</i>] Sarah? Come in.<br>
[<i>SARAH enters. JOHN returns to his seat</i>]<br>
BENWAY: I've decided to give you a shot. Welcome onto the team.<br>
SARAH: Thank you. <br>
BENWAY: Don't thank me; you're going to have to work fucking hard. [<i>pause</i>] You don't have to do it standing up though.<br>
[<i>she takes a seat</i>]<br>
SARAH: Er, What is the project?<br>
BENWAY: It's...<br>
JOHN: We're selling slippers.<br>
BENWAY: Yes.<br>
SARAH: Slippers?<br>
JOHN: Expensive brand name slippers.<br>
SARAH: OK.<br>
JOHN: I know it's not the most glamorous contract we have, but...<br>
BENWAY: Pull this off and we'll be heroes. Our praises sung.<br>
JOHN: Our deeds told in song.<br>
BENWAY: And unlike other heroes, we'll be rich too.<br>
SARAH: I didn't say a word.<br>
BENWAY: By the way, we're not the only agency involved.<br>
JOHN: Who else?<br>
BENWAY: Goldberg Associates. They're also after this contract. <br>
SARAH: So we both develop a sales concept, and the client picks the winner.<br>
BENWAY: No: we both develop a sales concept, and the client picks us. The way we make that happen is this: Firstly we've got to beat those suckers to the punch: get our idea in first, sell it hard and sell it well. Secondly: we've got to be better than them.<br>
JOHN: Don't worry.<br>
BENWAY: There is another factor to bear in mind. The client mentioned that they get a lot of their production done in the third world in conditions that, might best be kept quiet.<br>
JOHN: What are we talking about?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SARAH: What... kind of conditions?<br>
BENWAY: They didn't say. They were just highlighting a concern about potential bad publicity. So far they've not been targeted. But it is a factor, especially since our campaign is going to raise their profile somewhat.<br>
JOHN: They're putting their head above the parapet.<br>
BENWAY: Exactly. So our campaign has to be un-bustable. And it has to be so cool, it wins the generation x-ers over.<br>
JOHN: Anything else we should know before putting our brilliant brains to work?<br>
BENWAY: Yeah, your flies are undone.<br>
JOHN: My loins need the ventilation.<br>
BENWAY: I often have that effect on people. OK team, let's take a break. Reconvene in ten.<br>
SARAH: OK.<br>
BENWAY: Sarah, although you are the junior team-member, I'm going to entrust you with an important job.<br>
JOHN: Watch out girl, he's about to shit on you from a great height.<br>
SARAH: I'm up to whatever the job takes.<br>
BENWAY: I want you to bring me a coffee.<br>
JOHN: Oh dear - that's one risky job. Benway is a coffee purist.<br>
BENWAY: I prefer to think of myself as a `coffee fascist'.<br>
SARAH: [<i>deep breath</i>] I hope you realise I am not some little woman who'll do your menial tasks. I am a strong and independent person and I am only doing this to suck up to you.<br>
BENWAY: Black. No sugar. I'm sweet enough already.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 2: The Office</h2><br>
[<i>BENWAY's office 10 minutes later. BENWAY, JOHN and SARAH are all seated. BENWAY has a coffee. SARAH is the outsider here and is endearingly uncertain of herself. JOHN and BENWAY are not aware of excluding her.</i>]<br>
BENWAY: Firstly let's decide on our target demographic?<br>
JOHN: So I think we should be going for several different types of people. <br>
BENWAY: There are six billion different types of people last time I counted. Which ones were you thinking of?<br>
JOHN: There may be six billion different types of people, but only eight demographic groups. And if that's not very precise, well it is often easier to change the market - that is change the consumers to meet the product. <br>
BENWAY: Yes, I know. We are currently in the age of carpet-bombing. The next stage though will be accurately targeted advertising. Statistically guided marketing that zeroes in precisely on individual consumers. But I'm day-dreaming. Let's focus on who will buy our slippers. John?<br>
JOHN: Well we should go after a cross-section of classes, rich to poor.<br>
BENWAY: So we pitch it as a quality product.<br>
JOHN: But worn by people who are cool rather than particularly rich. We go for teenagers to middle-age. So we pitch it at 20 year olds, because everyone wants to be 20.<br>
BENWAY: I have trained you well. Sarah, any thoughts?<br>
SARAH: [<i>slight pause; she wants to impress but can't think of anything to add</i>] I agree. What do we know about the product?<br>
BENWAY: Well, there's a box of samples over there. Help yourself.<br>
SARAH: I'm thinking, is there anything that makes it special. Something that we can turn into a unique selling point.<br>
JOHN: A revolutionary special fabric that makes them warmer.<br>
SARAH: Is that true?<br>
BENWAY: It could be. <br>
SARAH: Sorry?<br>
BENWAY: The truth is whatever we say it is. Not that we lie; you don't have to lie. We imply. We suggest. We use the power of imagery.<br>
JOHN: Though the real world can be a good source of inspiration.<br>
BENWAY: True. But this is all irrelevant. This is not that kind of brand, or that sort of product. It's no good convincing the proles our slippers are the best; they're still not going to buy them and certainly not at top dollar. We need to sell them a style of life, an image, that they'll be willing to pay for. So forget the product itself, focus on the brand. What we're selling is sex, youth, freedom, love, friendship, all that is good and slippers. They buy the slippers as a down payment on the rest.<br>
JOHN: Of course we also want them to think the product is top quality.<br>
BENWAY: The high price will convince them of that.<br>
SARAH: What mediums are we using?<br>
BENWAY: Anything and everything. The core will be a TV campaign, but with lots of support. I'm looking at saturation coverage. Our target audience won't be able to take a shit without seeing our advertising. They will live and breathe it until they can't remember a time when it wasn't part of them.<br>
JOHN: What about sponsorship?<br>
BENWAY: What about it?<br>
JOHN: I say `hell yes'. Celebrity endorsements.<br>
BENWAY: OK Who?<br>
SARAH: How about Bagpuss? [<i>she looks to JOHN for a smile of support</i>]<br>
[<i>Note: I don't know how if an American audience would know Bagpuss. If not, Bert &amp; Ernie would be a suitable replacement.</i>]<br>
JOHN: Dear Bagpuss, Old fat furry cat-puss...<br>
SARAH: Yeah, he's got that laid back feel that'd be just right for slippers.<br>
JOHN: Hell he practically is a slipper. Slightly alternative yet widely liked. Evokes nostalgia in the 20 somethings and above.<br>
BENWAY: [<i>to JOHN</i>] Yes Bagpuss works for me too. No wait, he's BBC.<br>
SARAH: So?<br>
BENWAY: BBC are fuckers for licensing. Keep a tight rein on their brands.<br>
JOHN: Going for a different image: The Beckhams.<br>
BENWAY: In slippers? We're not that rich. Don't get hung up on just celebrities though. I want us to be everywhere. Sponsoring sports clubs, music. <br>
JOHN: Yes, I'm thinking acoustic performances.<br>
SARAH: Yes. Nice and cosy. <br>
BENWAY: See if you can get a liqueur company interested in going halves. Also comedy, community projects - get 'em young. Remember, TV time is expensive. Celebrities are expensive. But people are cheap. [<i>checks his watch</i>] I have another meeting. [<i>BENWAY exits</i>]<br>
JOHN: [<i>now giving her his attention</i>] How are you finding your first day of the big time?<br>
SARAH: It's a little intimidating.<br>
JOHN: Of course.<br>
SARAH: But nothing I can't handle.<br>
JOHN: A tough girl.<br>
SARAH: A professional.<br>
JOHN: Of course. I wouldn't have recommended you for the job otherwise.<br>
SARAH: You did?<br>
JOHN: Well yes, Benway asked me who'd be good.<br>
SARAH: Thank you. [<i>light jokey tone</i>] I'll remember it when I make partner.<br>
JOHN: [<i>friendly sarcasm</i>] Partner?<br>
SARAH: [<i>sarcastically naive</i>] You know, like they recently made Benway.<br>
JOHN: Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?<br>
SARAH: I intend to be up there with the best.<br>
JOHN: I guess you've got to think big.<br>
SARAH: [<i>slight pause</i>] Does it bother you that thing about... <br>
JOHN: About?<br>
SARAH: About the client and the sweatshop thing.<br>
JOHN: [<i>shrugs</i>] They're all the same these companies. Anyway, it's not our business really. We don't have anything to do with that.<br>
SARAH: [<i>looks doubtful</i>]<br>
JOHN: You're not having second thoughts about the job are you?<br>
SARAH: No, not at all.<br>
JOHN: Good. It's a fucking good opportunity, you know?<br>
SARAH: I know. Tell me, who else did you consider?<br>
JOHN: Well, we thought of Dante.<br>
SARAH: [<i>she is impressed at the idea of having been chosen above Dante</i>] Dante Contreras?<br>
JOHN: Yes, but he's taking a leave of absence to spend more time with his psychiatrist. Then Benway suggested Rory.<br>
SARAH: Hah! I mean, he's competent but hardly... you know.<br>
JOHN: What?<br>
SARAH: Hasn't got any real creative zip or pzaz.<br>
JOHN: At the risk of talking jargon, he's a tosser. <br>
[<i>SARAH laughs</i>]<br>
JOHN: So I said, No; let's give the lovely Miss Armstrong a chance.<br>
[<i>SARAH smiles at him</i>]<br>
JOHN: Benway'll be back soon. Let's sell some slippers.<br>
SARAH: You know Benway well?<br>
JOHN: Yes, he's like the abusive father I never had.<br>
SARAH: But his bark is worse than his bite...<br>
JOHN: Dunno. [<i>smiles</i>] In Benway's case, underneath the hard exterior, there's a pretty hard heart. Don't get me wrong; he's good friend. But... [<i>shrugs</i>]<br>
SARAH: He is quite demanding, isn't he? Quite intense.<br>
JOHN: You think he's demanding now? Just wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 3: The Office</h2><br>
[<i>Another shot of jazz, then lights up on a conference room, 1 week later. SARAH and JOHN are seated, BENWAY is standing. The group dynamics have shifted: SARAH and JOHN are both cultivating each other.</i>]<br>
BENWAY: What is this shit? You've given me shit. I'm meant to go to the client with this? This stuff wouldn't sell bread to a starving man. I need to see some better ideas.<br>
SARAH: We're trying our best.<br>
BENWAY: Trying? What the fuck is trying? The only thing you're trying is my patience. What fucking business do you think we're in? I don't give a shit for you trying your best. So far your best ain't good enough. It cuts no mustard, is up to no scratch, stands no test, fails all relevant EU standards and is neither seaworthy nor fit for human consumption. In short, it sucks. Go away. Do better than your best.<br>
SARAH: It's not easy trying to make slippers cool.<br>
BENWAY: You want off the project?<br>
SARAH: No.<br>
JOHN: Sarah's just saying it's a challenging project.<br>
BENWAY: Look, any fool can sell a good product. You are not fools. You are the fucking talent. Your job - our job - is to stop those fools who are selling good products by selling our product instead.<br>
SARAH: I did have an idea.<br>
BENWAY: Go on.<br>
SARAH: We don't sell them as slippers.<br>
BENWAY: No? What do we sell them as? Lamp-shades?<br>
SARAH: Instead of slippers, we call them `house shoes'.<br>
BENWAY: House shoes. <br>
SARAH: Yes.<br>
JOHN: I like it.<br>
BENWAY: It's better. It might work.<br>
SARAH: Well thank you. I'll try not to let that go to my head.<br>
BENWAY: I meant, good work. Yes, we're going to win this contract team. We've got a long way to go, but I believe we can do it. Now this is where it counts. This is where we show what we're made of. Whether we're ad-men or ad-mice. The pressure is on team, and the clock is ticking. Can you do it?<br>
SARAH: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN: Yes Sir.<br>
BENWAY: I know you can, but you've got to get going, you've got to prove what you're made of. [<i>pause</i>] OK. [<i>sitting down</i>] Let's brainstorm.<br>
[<i>sometime later... (dip lights. BENWAY is seated, JOHN and SARAH shift closer together. raise lights)</i>]<br>
SARAH: You're shooting down everything we say.<br>
BENWAY: No-one said this would be easy.<br>
JOHN: [<i>tired but trying</i>][<i>to SARAH</i>] What do we know about the company. Is there anything there that we can use?<br>
SARAH: I can forward you their PR literature.<br>
JOHN: Thanks.<br>
BENWAY: [<i>sensing he is being cut out and suddenly feeling threatened by SARAH, BENWAY reacts by asserting his dominant alpha-male status.</i>] Hah. Don't bother. Their PR department are a bunch of amateurs who copy their copy off the side of cornflake packets. Economy value cornflakes at that.<br>
JOHN: What, 'these slippers are fortified with vitamins and minerals'?<br>
BENWAY: No - it's just standard issue crap. A boring story about their boring founder. Blah, blah, blah - manufactured to exacting standards using the latest in child labour, etc. etc.<br>
SARAH: [<i>to JOHN</i>] Something I don't get there.<br>
JOHN: What?<br>
SARAH: Well, if the client is worried about how they're seen to treat their workers, why don't they just treat them better? Would it really cost that much?<br>
JOHN: Well...<br>
BENWAY: [<i>cutting in</i>] Let me explain the way things work. Mr Jameson is on the board, he makes those decisions. He's there because he's good at his job. His job is to make lots of money for the shareholders, the other directors and himself. Not just some money, but as much as possible. And not just because he's greedy - he has to, or the stock market would punish the company. He was promoted over the heads of other - perhaps even more able - men because they didn't deliver as much or as quickly or as reliably. Perhaps they put family first or too close a second, perhaps they weren't hard-headed enough. No matter; he made it, they didn't. He makes decisions. The problems are abstract, clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;He considers graphs, commissions tables of numbers, applies unwritten equations. <br>
It's all very simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands ethics. Ethics is an equation: potential profits versus the risk of bad publicity. He goes home to his wife and children. He's not a bad father - if not around much - wants what is best for his children. Wants them to grow up in a decent world. Indeed the world he lives in is good and decent. There are parks and trees, no litter or homeless.<br>
SARAH: So he's hard-headed. So are the unions.<br>
JOHN: She's right.<br>
BENWAY: But not everywhere has unions. Mr Ramirez runs a factory in a such a place.<br>
JOHN: Ramirez is a first name, not a surname.<br>
BENWAY: Who died and made you professor? So Mr ... <br>
JOHN: Santiago.<br>
BENWAY: Mr Santiago runs a factory. He's a piece of human slime. Very few people are, but he is. Maria is a teenage girl. She works 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, plus (unpaid) overtime, sewing clothes for Mr Santiago. Mr Jameson has an order to sub-contract. He gives it to Mr Santiago, who is considerably cheaper than the closed British factory his company used to own. Then Mr Jameson takes an evening off to be with his family. He reads his daughter a bedtime story.<br>
SARAH: And we're working for this Jameson creep?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
BENWAY: No no for fuck's sake no: Jameson doesn't exist. I made him up. I was just explaining shit to you. None of that was real. I don't fucking know what our client is like. Maybe they're fucking lovely. Maybe they give cute rabbits to all their employees and they're only worried because there was one guy at the factory they couldn't find a Christmas present for. I don't know, and I don't fucking care. Our job is just to sell the stuff. Not just for Mr mythical Jameson, but for the good of the whole economy and our own jobs.<br>
SARAH: This can't be right.<br>
BENWAY: Wake up girl. Which cloud cuckoo land are you living in?<br>
SARAH: Surely someone would do something. People aren't cruel.<br>
JOHN: Present company excepted.<br>
BENWAY: Ah, people - the consumers, the the ones we sell too. Let's consider the consumers. <br>
Keith is an honest man. He earns his living. Everything he knows about economics, government and politics he gets from his daily paper. He thinks the world is pretty simple (his is), and has no time for intellectual nonsense. He might be very smart or quite dumb; it doesn't really matter. He'll still buy the product. <br>
Alex is an educated young man. He's a member of a couple of charities. He disapproves of the USA's ecological, social and foreign policy. He watches films with subtitles. He owns a car, TV, video, computer, stereo, sports equipment, laptop, mobile phone, goes on holiday (travels) once a year. And he also buys the product. <br>
Gary can't afford to pay all his taxes; you wouldn't believe the cost of living in London. This shit doesn't interest him; he has problems of his own. But the product - the product is cool.<br>
SARAH: But that's our fault!<br>
BENWAY: Our success you mean. Generating wealth that trickles down to all. [<i>shrugs</i>] Someone's going to get rich doing it. Why not us?<br>
JOHN: [<i>lighthearted</i>] Benway, is there anything you won't do?<br>
BENWAY: Yes. I won't lose the contract.<br>
JOHN: [<i>to SARAH</i>] Benway sold his immortal soul long ago.<br>
BENWAY: Hell yes, and at a good price.<!--, but my soul wasn't immortal. It only had a three year guarantee.--><br>
SARAH: What do you think about this John?<br>
JOHN: Well I'm not ecstatic about it.<br>
BENWAY: OK seriously OK suppose. Suppose we did a lousy job of protecting the client's image. Suppose some newspaper articles and a televised protest bring out all the dirt. Well that would alter the ethics equation - temporarily. Mr Jameson insists on better conditions in the factory, gets on the phone to the PR department who start saying all the right things. It is a caring company. Conditions improve in the factory. But then the contract is moved to China where they have slave labour and offer better protection from journalists. The factory closes; everyone who worked there gets sacked. None of this appears on the balance sheet, or on the price tag.<br>
SARAH: Wouldn't there be more protests?<br>
BENWAY: Let me tell you about the protesters. Amongst them are some real smart people with hearts of gold, and also a lot mung-bean-eating sandal-wearing cliches - that's not leather sandals but soya bean skin. <br>
JOHN: A mixed bunch.<br>
BENWAY: Quite. Take Sebastian for example. Goes to public school. He hates it and he hates his father for sending him there. He's a real rebel, although one day he'll work in the City too. He goes to a demonstration, puts a brick through a shop window.<br>
Joe is a radical. He lives in a squat, attends meetings, hands out leaflets, shouts at the police who he calls pigs. He is part of something and they don't give a fuck and they're going to change things; the revolution cannot be stopped. He is against the (fascist) police, against the (corrupt) laws, against the middle class who he always calls the bourgeois, against capitalism, against the pathetic fluffies, against the USA (also fascists), against banks, lawyers, accountants and everyone else who is part of the system. He is an idiot; it's exciting.<br>
Then we have Mina. Mina cares. About everything. She's trying to put the glare of public scrutiny on injustice, but it's more of a 40 watt glow than a glare because she hasn't got the budget for the powerful spotlight of coordinated TV ads, glossy ads, billboards, sponsorship and product placement. She's got candle lit vigils - which don't cut quite the same wattage as our dazzling marketing strategies. So she relies on the media.<br>
Rupert is the media, and in a word, he's a cunt. More specifically he is a greedy power hungry cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;That combined with cunning money, luck and no principles to encumber him have made him very successful. He has a media empire and politicians are afraid of him. His editors congenitally confuse his interests with the public interest. Jack is a reporter. He sees the brick and the broken shop window and writes about a riot. He adds a paragraph about the bleeding hearts - what do they call themselves now?<br>
JOHN: I believe it's the anti-corporate-power, pro-democracy movement these days.<br>
BENWAY: Right. Same bunch of hippies, just a different T-shirt. Who'd have thought they had more than one? Anyway: Our reporter adds something about the politics behind the protest, but his editor tells him to ditch it. With me so far?<br>
SARAH: Your simplifying-<br>
BENWAY: Like crazy. The unsimplified truth is beyond any man's understanding. <br>
SARAH: I'm not a man.<br>
BENWAY: Sweet. <br>
SARAH: Is this still the short answer?<br>
BENWAY: Yes. So now we have the politicians - but they can't take a moral stand. Partly because they haven't got that much power anymore, partly because they wouldn't anyhow.<br>
SARAH: Why not?<br>
BENWAY: Every environment defines a selection procedure. All you need is success and failure and too many people who want to play the game for all to succeed. The bigger the numbers the worse it is. Sometimes there is an official selection procedure, but this is only part of the real selection procedure.<br>
JOHN: Most enlightening zen master, but meaning what?<br>
BENWAY: Meaning sometimes the freedom of the vote is like Henry Ford's 'Have any colour you like as long as it's black'. These days they're all compromised if not actively corrupt. Making up an example, say Alex is an MP. He was elected by 20,522 of his constituents; that was the easy part. The real work was getting his way up the party ladder. If he hadn't cared about power, if he wasn't willing to compromise - he would never have got there.<br>
He still double thinks of himself as an idealistic man, but he's ambitious and does what he's told. He is ostensibly representing constituents whose lives he knows very little about. And the higher up the ladder you go, the further you get from anything real. So it gets worse. Tony used to be an idealist; now he is a politician. He listens to sensible economic advice. He considers the next election. He tries to keep the papers and the market happy.<br>
SARAH: What about the good things? <br>
BENWAY: Such as?<br>
SARAH: Whenever there's a famine or disaster, we give aid.<br>
BENWAY: Which is a fraction of the debt repayments most of these countries make to us.<br>
SARAH: Kosovo - the Kosovo campaign was a purely moral action.<br>
JOHN: That's right.<br>
BENWAY: Hey, there are no absolutes. This shit I'm talking isn't the absolute truth. This is just the short answer, remember?<br>
SARAH: But basically, in your black-tinted view of the world, democracy is dead? <br>
BENWAY: No, democracy is spreading. However true democracy - where people hold the power - that may turn out to be an ephemeral passing thing. Perhaps we have already passed the high tide point. How empowered do you feel when you cast your vote? Do you even bother these days?<br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
BENWAY: Mr Smith is an economist. He has been trained. He looks at statistics, applies formulae according to theory. Because he only partially understands his subject, his analysis is firm and dogmatic. It's a subconscious defensive thing. Meanwhile the big companies employ lobbying firms to make sure the government doesn't do anything stupid. They have as much money as governments these days, which means they have power. And their power is concentrated and they know how to use it.<br>
JOHN: [<i>to SARAH</i>] I think the short answer is almost done.<br>
BENWAY: Shit, I didn't mean to rant so much. You want the really short answer? The numbers are too big, and there isn't anything else to control that. There are more people than jobs. Hence the laws of supply and demand say that people are not valuable. There.<br>
JOHN: [<i>to SARAH</i>] Benway is a true cynic.<br>
BENWAY: No, a realist. What the fuck could you or I do anyway? It sucks, but that's the way it is. The numbers are too big. The human aspect gets dwarfed by the statistical pressures. And each piece slots together, each bit supports the others to build a vast interlocking system that's pretty damn stable.<br>
[<i>pause; having won the argument, BENWAY no longer knows why he started it in the first place</i>]<br>
BENWAY: But what the fuck do I know? History has no respect for our predictions. <!-- Perhaps generosity and community will some day turn out to be profitable enough to work. --> Fuck, in a day it could all change. Hell, an hour would be enough. Everything changes, you can make a fresh start with your final breath. [<i>sigh</i>] It's gone 8 o'clock. Class dismissed.<br>
JOHN: Anyone for a drink?<br>
BENWAY: No thanks.<br>
JOHN: Not like you.<br>
BENWAY: Don't want to miss my ballet class.<br>

JOHN: Slippers. What a shitty account.<br>
SARAH: Don't say that. I've waited so long to work on an account at this level - to be there mapping out the whole campaign, designing the strategy, seeing the big picture. [<i>beat</i>] I love the job. It's the only job. I even love the stress. <br>
JOHN: I know what you mean. It's a real high, all that adrenalin pumping round your veins.<br>

JOHN: Or perhaps it's that you walk in beauty, like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies, And all that's best of dark and bright / Meet in your aspect and your eyes. <br>
SARAH: Ah. Such lovely things. You're just saying that.<br>
JOHN: Oh, I am only saying that to get you into bed. But I wouldn't want to get you into bed if it weren't true. <br>

<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 5: The Office</h2><br>
[<i>A conference room, the next day (Friday). BENWAY and JOHN are seated</i>]<br>
BENWAY: Monkey see, monkey like.<br>
JOHN: Cheers.<br>
[<i>SARAH enters</i>]<br>
SARAH: Morning. Hello, you're here early.<br>
BENWAY: John's had an idea for the campaign - a good one. Tell her.<br>
JOHN: So this is the TV ad: A young and beautiful couple at home. They're having a glass of wine. Studio flat, stylish but homely. She's wearing the slippers - house shoes. They smile at each other - it's a sexual smile - they head for the bed. She slips off her house shoes; graceful and very sexy. Perhaps a shot of her from behind: her perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;back as her blouse falls away. And I don't think this girl wears a bra when she's at home. Blouse flutters down to land by the house shoes. Then we have him. He's wearing boots, he's trying to take them off, but what with all the hormones and pheromones flying round, he makes a mess of it. Lots of haste, not much speed.<br>
BENWAY: What do you think?<br>
SARAH: It sounds awfully familiar.<br>
JOHN: Slogan, maybe: `get comfortable'.<br>
BENWAY: What do you mean?<br>
SARAH: You thieving bastard. That's my idea Mr Benway. It's mine. You -<br>
JOHN: What are you talking about?<br>
SARAH: Don't act innocent. It's my idea - I told him that idea yesterday.<br>
JOHN: No you fucking didn't.<br>
BENWAY: Why didn't you tell it to me?<br>
SARAH: It was after work.<br>
BENWAY: This is a serious accusation Sarah.<br>
SARAH: It's the truth.<br>
BENWAY: John?<br>
JOHN: I have no idea what this bitch is on about. I've never stolen an idea in my life.<br>
BENWAY: Did you meet up after work?<br>
JOHN: Yeah.<br>
BENWAY: Did you talk about the campaign?<br>
JOHN: No.<br>
SARAH: He's lying.<br>
JOHN: You're delirious.<br>
BENWAY: Quiet. [<i>pause</i>] Sarah - Have you got any evidence to back this up?<br>
SARAH: er... wait, yes I have. I wrote it down last night. It's here in black and white in my folder.<br>
BENWAY: Show me.<br>
SARAH: [<i>searching frantically</i>] It's - it's not here. Shit, I - I swear it was here. That arsehole must have pinched it.<br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
BENWAY: That arsehole is a friend of mine.<br>
SARAH: You don't believe me? <br>
BENWAY: John and I go back. You, I hardly know. You're young but you're not innocent. And you don't have any evidence. So no, I don't believe you.<br>
JOHN: There's the door girl - don't let it hit you on your way out.<br>
SARAH: There's the window arsehole - don't let the blinds hit you on your way down.<br>
BENWAY: Enough. This is my theory: Sarah, you probably had the germ of an idea. Maybe it was the germ of this idea. You said a few vague things. The germ was planted and flowered in John's mind. Now you say 'this is my idea'. But it ain't. You probably said some offhand thing, John produces the goods - and you think what he's done is the obvious development of what you said.<br>
SARAH: That's not it at all. This is my idea. I had the whole fucking idea. I had the entire advert. Except for the slogan - which I might say, sucks.<br>
BENWAY: Look, I've had that feeling before. But I know it for what it is, which is self-serving bullshit. Now I've worked with John for years. You're just a little girl. But your ambitious and greedy or you wouldn't be here. So you're giving yourself the benefit of too much doubt, and trying to take some credit that isn't really yours.<br>
SARAH: I swear to you -<br>
BENWAY: Don't. All that means is that you've convinced yourself. That's a captive and not very critical audience.<br>
JOHN: What do we do now?<br>
BENWAY: What do you mean?<br>
JOHN: I don't see how she can stay on after this.<br>
BENWAY: I'm going to think about this before I make any rash decisions. [<i>JOHN starts to object</i>] Uh - It's my call &amp; I'm not making it yet. For now, we carry on as before. Act like you're grown-ups for fucks sake. Sarah go home. You've got the rest of the day off to cool your head. <br>
SARAH: This isn't fair. <!-- BENWAY: No? Tomorrow I expect to see some work from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;SARAH: You've already seen some. --><br>
BENWAY: I'll see you tomorrow.<br>
[<i>SARAH exits</i>]<br>
JOHN: I can't believe she tried to pull that shit. I can't believe it.<br>
BENWAY: An ugly business.<br>
JOHN: Yeah. Fuckin' hell. Fucking unbelievable.<br>
BENWAY: Christ John, why did you have to sleep with her?<br>
JOHN: It was...<br>
BENWAY: I ask you to stay away from one girl.<br>
JOHN: How did you know we'd...?<br>
BENWAY: Been intimate like rabbits? It was obvious. It was bloody obvious.<br>
JOHN: I got carried away. It was a mistake.<br>
BENWAY: No shit.<br>
JOHN: It won't happen again.<br>
BENWAY: [<i>laughing</i>] No fucking shit.<br>
JOHN: You know we did talk about the project. Maybe she said more than I realised.<br>
BENWAY: Maybe nothing. You want to go for a drink?<br>
JOHN: Now?<br>
BENWAY: Over an early lunch.<br>
JOHN: Sure. OK.<br>
BENWAY: Good. By the power vested in me I hereby cancel the rest of today.<br>
JOHN: An ugly business.<br>

JOHN: Where's Benway?<br>
[<i>silence</i>]<br>
SARAH: You fucking bastard.<br>
[<i>JOHN is not pure pond-slime. He hadn't decided for certain on betrayal until he actually did it, and hence thinks of it as a spur of the moment slip in ethics (not his true self). He likes SARAH, and feels regret, although perhaps expresses it poorly.</i>]<br>
JOHN: It's a dog eat dog world.<br>
SARAH: You cunt. You even promised: 'oh let me look; I would never steal'.<br>
JOHN: Hey, I may have said I wouldn't steal, but I never said I wouldn't lie.<br>
SARAH: You're fucking unbelievable. And to think I - arh!<br>
JOHN: I'm sorry. I was in his office and it just came out. And...<br>
SARAH: You make me sick.<br>
JOHN: I didn't plan this. Could we try to put it behind us?<br>
SARAH: I don't see how.<br>
[<i>pause. BENWAY enters</i>]<br>
BENWAY: Morning team.<br>
SARAH: Mr Benway, I have a new idea.<br>
BENWAY: Oh good; I knew we hired you for something. <br>
JOHN: Behave yourself Benway. I'm sorry Sarah. Please, hit us.<br>
SARAH: Don't tempt me. [<i>she stands and addresses BENWAY</i>] <br>
BENWAY: What aspect of the campaign is it for?<br>
SARAH: It's not - I mean, it's an idea for a wholly new campaign.<br>
BENWAY: It's a little late in the day to start from scratch.<br>
SARAH: Please - this is a better idea. And I've done a lot of the preparation. We could easily switch.<br>
BENWAY: Hmm. OK, I'm listening.<br>
SARAH: First up: the bedroom scene - it's hardly groundbreaking. The tried and tested methods, well they're tried and tested - and forgettable. But do something different and you get people's attention, you get noticed, talked about. Lots of free publicity.<br>
BENWAY: So what have you got that's never been seen before?<br>
SARAH: We open with a shot of some third world sweatshop. It's a grim place. We use grainy film to suggest documentary footage. Subtitles: It doesn't have to be this way.<br>
JOHN: Is this meant to be a joke?<br>
SARAH: Wait and learn. [<i>back to BENWAY</i>] It's too grim, we don't want to be there. Slide cut to a party. Still in the same part of the world, but this time it's exotic. The people aren't rich, but they look cool. They're happy, they're wearing house shoes, slipping in and out of them, dancing laughing. Subtitles:<br>
Actual employees /&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in wages / that allow you to live / properly. <br>
BENWAY: I don't get it.<br>
SARAH: Part of it is, the client will have to budget for paying them a decent wage. In return they can hike their prices even higher. Also we find some sexy employees and some earthy employees and turn them into our celebrities - big saving there. We're selling sex, youth, freedom, love, friendship, all that is good and slippers.<br>
BENWAY: You're right: it is new. Well done, you've got something there. I hate to say this, but: no.<br>
SARAH: No?<br>
BENWAY: [<i>shakes his head</i>] Not a chance in hell.<br>
SARAH: [<i>brittle</i>] The company's worried about it's human rights image - well this will make them heroes.<br>
BENWAY: Yes perhaps it would. There are consumers who shop ethically and we'd get them. But they belong to the demographic group F1: freaks and wierdos.<br>
SARAH: Why are they freaks?<br>
BENWAY: They're freaks because there aren't enough of them. Most consumers are happy just as long as they don't have to know about the bad shit.<br>
SARAH: Yes, but we're making this a selling point. Part of the brand image.<br>
BENWAY: The bottom line is that the ethical market is too small. Anyway, you can get your hands on a fair amount of that market just by selling the product in mottled brown packaging with a picture of a happy foreign peasant. Shit I'm sorry girl. Don't get disheartened. It's bold and it's original. But realistically, it'd never work.<br>
SARAH: [<i>close to tears</i>] So I guess we go with my first idea.<br>
JOHN: Watch it.<br>
BENWAY: Remember, the client is coming round tomorrow. So you two are good colleagues for the day. I mean it - best fucking behaviour or the dole queue. And no swearing. [<i>checks watch</i>] Get the place ready, I have shit to do. [<i>BENWAY exits</i>]<br>
[<i>SARAH is dejected at this point and just wants to make it through the day. However with Benway out of the room, she finally achieves some power. Gradually she regains a bit of strength and defiance.</i>]<br>

JOHN: Right, I think we're ready. Good work Sarah.<br>
BENWAY: [<i>looks around critically, nods some sort of approval</i>] Right. <br>
JOHN: You don't seem very excited.<br>
BENWAY: I'll be enthusiastic when I need to be.<br>
JOHN: This is the big pitch. Make or break.<br>
BENWAY: Well. It's not just that this kind of campaign has been done before. It's been done before by me. Right, we're almost ready. John - hire some models for the day - beautiful, but sharp.<br>
JOHN: Female?<br>
BENWAY: A few of each. Remember to get an asian and a black.<br>
SARAH: What are you hiring models for?<br>
BENWAY: We give them clipboards and a bit of paperwork and tell them to look dynamic. It impresses the client.<br>
SARAH: That's ridiculous.<br>
BENWAY: Remember we are in the image business. If we can't take care of our own image, how are we going to help theirs? Oh and Sarah; wear your glasses tomorrow and show subtle cleavage.<br>
SARAH: Subtle cleavage?<br>
BENWAY: Yes subtle cleavage Miss Harrison. As if you are sexy, sophisticated and intelligent. I wish you to use your body and feminine wiles to help sell this company. And Miss Harrison?<br>

JOHN: And how the fuck did you get the client to buy it?<br>
BENWAY: You forget kid. I'm a salesman.<br>
JOHN: This is a fucking mistake. You have lost it Benway.<br>
BENWAY: Maybe.<br>
[<i>JOHN exits angrily. pause. BENWAY leans back in his chair.</i>]<br>
BENWAY: You were good today. Especially given the short notice.<br>
SARAH: Thank you. From what I saw, you weren't too bad yourself.<br>
BENWAY: Of course there's no guarantee that the board will go with it.<br>
SARAH: But when they do their sums I think they'll agree.<br>
BENWAY: Yes. I was impressed with the thought you'd put in there. Keep outsourcing production, with a bill of rights for the illiterate workers and one showcase factory.<br>
SARAH: We tweak the proven model, remain competitive.<br>
BENWAY: Have our cake...<br>
SARAH: And eat it.<br>
BENWAY: You know, there was a story in the paper this morning about our client.<br>
SARAH: Really?<br>
BENWAY: Yeah - they did a short piece about their unfair labour practices. Not a big deal, but it rattled them.<br>
SARAH: Oh. Well, our campaign should help.<br>
BENWAY: Did you read it Sarah?<br>
SARAH: No, I get The Guardian. [<i>substitute an American newspaper</i>]<br>
BENWAY: This shit is important. You need to keep your eye on things. But I never said that it wasn't The Guardian.<br>
