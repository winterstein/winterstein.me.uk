Robert - Sincere but not overly sensitive. Tired.<br>
Rachel - Careworn but still attractive.<br>

SET<br>
A dingy kitchen. Centre stage is a table with a smart suit and a pad of paper laid out on it and a chair on either side. Stage right there is a door angled such that when it is open, we can see the landing. There is a light fitting over the table with a noose hanging from it. A framed portrait of RACHEL stands on a dresser or mantelpiece. The kitchen has a draw or cupboard which will be used to store the noose at one stage, and a bin.<br>

<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 1: The End</h2><br>
[<i>the CAT sits in view. JOHN enters in his dressing gown carrying a pair of smart shoes. He places these on the floor under the suit, strokes the cat, then steps back to face the cat and the audience.</i>]<br>
<br>
JOHN: Suicide is a complex matter and not to be undertaken lightly. It's final, for a start. Done properly [<i>pause implying a certain pride; he will do it properly</i>] there's no undoing it. Irrevocable - which means you'd better be sure. And yet all our actions are irrevocable. The moment that passes is gone forever. The man I was is already dead and gone. For right or wrong, what's done is done. For right or wrong - but lately it has been for wrong or worse. And though whilst there's life there's hope, but perhaps that hope is false. <br>
<br>
[<i>JOHN makes himself a cup of tea, but continues talking</i>]<br>
<br>
It is just a question of how and when to die. After all, it's not as if the alternative is to live forever. It just feels that way. And I think Western attitudes towards death are very unhealthy. We try to avoid admitting it will really happen to us. Trying to live forever. Almost quarantining the old and the sick - certainly keeping them at arms length in homes and hospices. As if death itself were somehow contagious.<br>
<br>
[<i>he considers the noose</i>] It's not ideal. I would have preferred to go out heroically. A dodgy fuel-line in a new fighter jet, a blaze of glory and everyone saying 'what a guy'. But no; I have lived too long. Now all my options are bad. A glorious high-octane death is hardly practical at my age. The best I can do is pick the least worst. [<i>his attention goes back to the noose</i>] This... Simple, tried &amp; tested. Eight out of ten suicides would recommend it, if it weren't so good. Still it's hardly original. Strange that that should bother me. There is the temptation to try a flashy suicide. Something tremendously clever involving rubber bands, pulleys and ice cubes. Something that would confuse the police for weeks.<br>
<br>
[<i>If possible, a comic strip or animation should be projected of a complex Heath-Robinson suicide involving rubber bands, pulleys and ice cubes.</i>]<br>
<br>
But... I would prefer to leave this life quietly, as one slips away from a party. A sleight of body trick to vanish without being noticed.<br>
<br>
I am haunted by certain images: The beached boat slowly rotting, holes showing through her ribs, the shooting star that burnt out. Above all, the image of the defeated soldier with no-one to surrender to. He is a broken down man. Still wearing his uniform, but no longer with any pride. His face etched with the wisdom of having made mistakes, of having lost greatly. All around him the land lies barren.<br>
<br>
I used to go with the flow but times and tides have changed, and you just can't go with the ebb. [<i>beat</i>] I have tried, and tried again. I have tried not let my past failures stop me from failing again. But it's hard. This broken life I lead – well I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Especially since I am my own worst enemy. We want so much from life, but there comes a point where we will settle for a <br>
dignified exit. <br>
<br>
What did I lose? Everything. No, not everything; just everything<br>
that matters. Most of all You. <br>
<br>
[<i>project an idealised image of RACHEL at her most beautiful</i>]<br>
<br>
You. You were my heart, my love, my life. You were...<br>
<br>
[<i>RACHEL enters in a soft warm spotlight, but when she speaks it is with a bitter angry voice, and the light changes to a harder tone</i>]<br>
RACHEL: You were an awful drunkard.<br>
JOHN: I was a brilliant drunkard. It was almost an art. Such virtuoso performances.<br>
RACHEL: You shit. You fucking shit.<br>
JOHN: It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fucking fault.<br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
RACHEL: [<i>turns away, pause, turns back</i>] The drink destroyed you.<br>
JOHN: [<i>sad</i>] It destroyed me bit by bit. Quitting would have destroyed me in an instant. [<i>v. slightly patronising</i>] It is normal to give away a little of one's life to avoid losing it all.<br>
<br>
RACHEL: You replaced me with a cat. [<i>goes to the cat, strokes it</i>] What's it called?<br>
JOHN: He. Sisypuss.<br>
RACHEL: [<i>nasty sarcasm</i>] Cute. Very clever.<br>
JOHN: [<i>angry</i>] Get out. You've haunted me long enough.<br>
RACHEL: Too bad. [<i>beat</i>] So you're taking the cowards way out?<br>
[<i>beat; they stare at each other</i>]<br>
JOHN: You can - [<i>turns away from her</i>] I have cancer.<br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
RACHEL: Liar.<br>
JOHN: Cancer of the heart.<br>
RACHEL: [<i>angry</i>] You pathetic self-pitying - It's still the same fucking tune. [<i>patronising</i>] Poor John, all he wanted was success and love without having to try. And when things didn't go exactly his way, he behaved like a pig. He felt hard done by, so he made everyone else suffer. He - [<i>chokes up</i>]<br>
JOHN: I wrecked my life. I know.<br>
RACHEL: Oh you did more than that. You were never one to underachieve.<br>
JOHN: [<i>anguish, guilt, love, etc.</i>] Rachel!<br>
[<i>RACHEL disappears, pause</i>]<br>
<br>
JOHN: Women Sisypuss. You are well off without them.<br>
CAT: Meow.<br>
JOHN: [<i>harsh</i>] What? [<i>softening</i>] Sorry. Sisypuss, you daft old cat. [<i>goes to the cat, strokes it</i>] Hey Sisypuss, do you know who you're named after? Did I ever tell you? Sisyphus, the ancient Greek. Who offended the gods and was punished by being doomed to toil eternally at a pointless task: pushing a rock up a hill for the rest of time. It's a joke see. Because you don't work at all. <br>
Sometimes I picture him, down there in the netherworld. Alone with that rock. I see him suffering. And I ask how long it's been.<br>
[<i>in an ancient voice</i>] 'It feels like forever,'<br>
[<i>normal voice</i>] he replies,<br>
[<i>Sisyphus voice</i>] 'But it has only been 3,000 years.'<br>
[<i>normal voice</i>] 'Why do you do it?' I ask. And he says:<br>
[<i>Sisyphus voice</i>] 'I am not the type to give up.'<br>
<br>
JOHN: [<i>to the cat</i>] That story used to bother me: Why did Sisyphus keep on trying? Why? He was dead, what further punishment could they inflict on him?<br>
I was contemplating this and that on the tree of woe, when the answer came to me. At first I thought it was despair that ruled him, but it isn't. He still has a grain of hope, you see? Hope will trap you.<br>
It doesn't take much to keep a man upright. Habit alone will do. Habit alone will keep you turning up, making conversation, even smiling. Between hope and habit, you can take anything and keep going. <br>
Can, not should.<br>
<br>
[<i>to the cat</i>] If I were you and you were me, if I were the animal, you would put me out of my misery.<br>
<br>
[<i>JOHN sits down and takes up a pen</i>] <br>
The note. <br>
[<i>He stares at the paper for a while.</i>]<br>
[<i>frustrated</i>] What's there to say? I have said everything already, and in several different ways. When all's said and done, it is a straightforward thing, and self-explanatory. I hardly need to leave a note to say I committed suicide. They're not going to think I tripped. And when all's said and done, shut up. <br>
[<i>stares at the paper some more</i>]<br>
Still something is needed, if only out of politeness.<br>
[<i>he starts writing</i>]<br>
<br>
No, urgh! [<i>screws up the paper and throws it at the bin</i>]<br>
<br>
I have grown old. I have grown weary.<br>
My will is made. My mind at peace.<br>
Farewell.<br>
[<i>JOHN considers the note disappointedly, signs it and puts down the pen. He changes into the suit and puts on his shoes. He then climbs onto the table, removes his glasses and places them in a suitable pocket. He is just fitting his head through the noose when the doorbell rings.</i>]<br>
JOHN: Shit.<br>
[<i>it rings again, quite insistently this time.</i>]<br>
JOHN: Who is it?<br>
ROBERT: [<i>offstage</i>] Me! Now get out of bed and open the door you lazy bugger. It's midday.<br>
[<i>JOHN takes his head out of the noose and unties it from the light fitting. His movements are hurried and embarrassed.</i>]<br>
JOHN: Just a minute.<br>
<br>
[<i>He climbs down, stows the noose in the draw, and opens the door</i>]<br>
<br>
ROBERT: Hello, how are you?<br>
JOHN: [<i>annoyed</i>] Fine.<br>
ROBERT: Not bad eh. Thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing.<br>
JOHN: There's this great new invention called the telephone. I might have been busy.<br>
ROBERT: Were you?<br>
JOHN: Well, no, not really.<br>
ROBERT: There you go then. Hang on, what's this? Nice suit, very smart.<br>
JOHN: [<i>embarrassed</i>] Nothing.<br>
ROBERT: Come on, where are you going?<br>
JOHN: Nowhere.<br>
ROBERT: Nowhere? You're putting on your Sunday best just to drink tea in the kitchen? I didn't realise this was such a high class joint. Shit - I'm underdressed. [<i>pause</i>] It's not just the suit. You're looking better all round. More alive. [<i>pause</i>] Is it a woman?<br>
JOHN: No.<br>
ROBERT: A lady?<br>
JOHN: No.<br>
ROBERT: OK don't tell me.<br>
JOHN: How's the business?<br>
ROBERT: [<i>without pride or happiness</i>] Doing well. [<i>pause</i>] I've been thinking.<br>
JOHN: A new hobby?<br>
ROBERT: I was thinking of offering you your job back.<br>
JOHN: It was never my job.<br>
[<i>ROBERT is silent. JOHN pushes the glass of whisky into sight</i>]<br>
ROBERT: John...<br>
JOHN: You still want to give me that job back?<br>
ROBERT: Yes.<br>
JOHN: Why? I was lousy.<br>
ROBERT: You just never tried properly.<br>
JOHN: Damn right. It was a lousy job. You should have sacked me long ago. Hell, you should never have given that job to me in the first place.<br>
ROBERT: I was trying to help.<br>
JOHN: I know.<br>
ROBERT: You needed a job. You still do.<br>
JOHN: Thanks, but I'll pass.<br>
ROBERT: I'm serious.<br>
JOHN: Thank you Robert. But I hated that job. You know I was never meant to sit in an office. I felt like I was dying in there.<br>
ROBERT: Yeah. But...<br>
JOHN: Damn it, Robert. We were pilots once.<br>
ROBERT: Yeah, once. But we're not so young anymore.<br>
JOHN: You remember though?&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember what it felt like to fly, to streak through the skies like a thunderbolt?<br>
ROBERT: Yeah I remember. [<i>takes a sip of whisky from the glass</i>] We were good.<br>
JOHN: [<i>also takes a sip</i>] You were good. I was the best.<br>
ROBERT: Those days are gone though.<br>
JOHN: Don't I know it.<br>
ROBERT: I saw Sam 'The Saint'...<br>
JOHN: [<i>guilty</i>] How is he?<br>
ROBERT: Not good. He can hardly walk. He jokes about his health, but...<br>
JOHN: But it's pretty bad.<br>
ROBERT: [<i>nods</i>] He's scared of dying.<br>
JOHN: He said that?<br>
ROBERT: No. He was... being cleaned by the nurses when I visited. And he said death must be scarier than flying fighters, because he never shat himself when he was a pilot. [<i>pause</i>] Joking. [<i>beat</i>] He laughed, said it was darkly funny, the way death is.<br>
JOHN: I understand. He wants us to think it's just bullshit. But it's only half bullshit. [<i>pause</i>] fuck. <br>
[<i>pause</i>]<br>
ROBERT: Look, I've got to get back to the office.<br>
[<i>they stand; ROBERT first</i>]<br>
JOHN: Hey Robert. [<i>pause</i>] Thanks for trying.<br>
ROBERT: Will you think about the job? [<i>pause</i>] Well. I best be going.<br>
[<i>JOHN shows ROBERT to the door</i>]<br>
ROBERT: Take care John.<br>
JOHN: Goodbye Robert. You're a good man. [<i>ROBERT makes as if to reply to this</i>] Goodbye.<br>
[<i>ROBERT leaves</i>]<br>
<br>
JOHN: [<i>to the door</i>] When you throw a rope to a drowning man there is always a tug of war - to pull himself out he must try to pull you in. No-one will blame you if you let go of the rope. [<i>closes the door</i>]<br>
He's a good man. Always there for me. He's never any help, but he's there and that ought to count for something.<br>
[<i>JOHN retrieves the noose and re-attaches it to the light fitting. He steps down to inspect his work.</i>]<br>
JOHN: What do I live for? Joy and love. And when joy and love are gone? Life must have purpose. Work worthy of a man. But when you can no longer work? No point raking cold ashes. One final purpose remains: to make a good exit.<br>
<br>
[<i>JOHN climbs onto the table and fits the noose again. Again the doorbell interrupts him. JOHN climbs down and answers it to find a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses on his doorstep.</i>]<br>
<br>
1ST WITNESS: Are you a Christian?<br>
[<i>JOHN cannot believe this shit</i>] <br>
2ND WITNESS: We'd like to talk to you about how Jesus can help you.<br>
<br>
JOHN: You've got five minutes. Starting now.<br>
<br>
?? religious speel, The end cometh etc. ??<br>
<br>
<br>
JOHN: What no-one understands is... can I be bothered? Why tell you? I don't have the right words, and there's just too much to explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't know where to begin. Or end. I'd only end up simplifying and trivialising myself. Making it all nice and simple for you so you get it, so this horrible reality of mine makes sense, except you can't simplify this shit. It'll end up as cliches and stereotypes and cheap answers. You want to know about my life - well there's a lifetime's worth of stories and details and it's all important and vital and rich but none of it relevant to you who just don't have a clue. And suppose I tried, and you listened, suppose we tried to talk and I didn't cut corners but poured it all out,all the love and the hurt and the muck and the beauty. Well, you still wouldn't understand. ??<br>
<br>
[<i>WITNESSES repeat their previous speel as if this outburst had not happened</i>]<br>
<br>
Jesus died for your sins.<br>
<br>
1ST WITNESS: Do not put off making peace with The Lord until tomorrow, for you may die tomorrow.<br>
JOHN: I might die today, if you'll leave me in peace. [<i>lets the door swing open so that they can see the noose</i>]<br>
1ST WITNESS: Uh!<br>
2ND WITNESS: No! [<i>crosses self</i>]<br>
1ST WITNESS: [<i>crosses self</i>] It is a sin to take your own life.<br>
2ND WITNESS: A mortal sin!<br>
JOHN: Mortal certainly. But what sin is there in dying?<br>
1ST WITNESS: In suicide? It is...<br>
2ND WITNESS: Against the Word of God.<br>
1ST WITNESS: A sin.<br>
2ND WITNESS: A grievous sin.<br>
JOHN: Why?<br>
2ND WITNESS: Because it is not your life to take.<br>
1ST WITNESS: God gives life, and only He may take it.<br>
JOHN: God will understand.<br>
2ND WITNESS: You must repent!<br>
1ST WITNESS: Yes! Repent!<br>
JOHN: Maybe I'll repent afterwards.<br>
2ND WITNESS: [<i>to his/herself</i>] Heresy! Mortal sin!<br>
1ST WITNESS: What about - your family?<br>
JOHN: [<i>smirking</i>] I guess my sisters will miss out on the golden memories of me dribbling, pissing myself and gabbling mindlessly.<br>
BOTH WITNESSES: Turn to The Lord! It is not too late!<br>
JOHN: Get a life. [<i>closes the door on them. producing a battered pack of cigarettes, he lights one</i>] I look on strangers as a drowning man looks at land [<i>beat</i>] on the horizon. I should know better by now. Strangers can't save you. You stand or fall by how you treat those close to you.<br>
<br>
[<i>picks up photo of Rachel and gazes at it</i>]<br>
<br>
Love! Love. To love is to risk losing. It is the greatest of gambles... Oh we were so beautiful at the beginning. I remember forgotten times. Unimportant moments when we were together. [<i>with energy</i>] A walk down by a creek under trees. A boy and a girl talk of idle and forgettable things. The day is sunny. He is just twenty, she eighteen. The world is opening up for both of them, and it will be sunny walks and soft kisses and hot kisses and late nights and wine and talk and such beautiful glorious action and it will never end. They stop beneath a spreading tree. <br>
He hardly knows her yet. She is an opening mystery by his side. She moves with elegance and grace. Acts with passion. So pure and true. A perfect beauty of a girl. A sweet natural eye to the world. Woke up and alive, all excited in the great flow of life. Rejoice! For such beauty was-is real, Rejoice! He lies back, and she lies with him. Kisses his face gently. He gazes up and his world is covered in canopies of green leaves and falling brown hair.<br>
[<i>sits</i>]<br>
We were happy then. Then.<br>
Everything ends badly. None of us pass through life without leaving a trail of tears behind. Our own and others. It’s the snail slime that sticks us together. What magic was it, to turn love into despair? An everyday miracle too terrible to behold. Yes, everything ends badly. Happiness is only ever on loan, and joy is a delicate transitory thing existing only for the moment, and what is true is true only for one time and one place, and all the rest of that shit. So here I am.<br>
<br>
[<i>RACHEL appears in a soft warm spotlight</i>]<br>
<br>
RACHEL: So are you doing it or not?<br>
JOHN: Yes.<br>
RACHEL: Well? What do you want? Congratulations?<br>
JOHN: [<i>on reflection</i>] Yes.<br>
RACHEL: What for?<br>
JOHN: I don't know. But it'd be nice. Doesn't have to be for anything as long as it's heartfelt.<br>
RACHEL: You don't deserve anything but pity, and you don't want that.<br>
JOHN: Why should everyone get what they deserve?<br>
RACHEL: That's justice.<br>
JOHN: So? giving it a name doesn't make it right.<br>
RACHEL: Ah! You've always got a clever reply. Got to be flippant about everything. Make everything shallow.<br>
JOHN: Properly understood everything is shallow.<br>
[<i>RACHEL regards him with anger and pity</i>]<br>
JOHN: No, I don't believe that either.<br>
RACHEL: [<i>softening, smiling</i>] But it's a good line.<br>
[<i>they share a warm gaze, RACHEL goes to his side</i>]<br>
RACHEL: I did love you. As best I could.<br>
JOHN: We had our moments.<br>
RACHEL: 12 happy years - well mostly happy.<br>
JOHN: Wonderful times.<br>
RACHEL: Yes.<br>
JOHN: Do you think Robert will look after the cat?<br>
RACHEL: Of course he will.<br>
JOHN: You can't explain these things to a cat.<br>
[<i>RACHEL kisses him</i>]<br>
JOHN: Goodbye Rachel.<br>
RACHEL: See you soon. [<i>exits</i>]<br>
<br>
JOHN: My mind returns to these images: The beached ship slowly rotting. The shooting star that burnt out. The defeated soldier with no-one to surrender to.<br>
[<i>JOHN climbs onto the table</i>]<br>
JOHN: Everything ends badly. But that is not the nature of things; only the nature of endings. It is time for a different image: The viking warrior. A big man, decked in his fighting clothes: the horned helmet, the rugged cloths. With his shield and sword, laid out on his back in a burning boat, floating down river to the sea.<br>
<br>
[<i>He fits the noose and steps off the table. The lights flash, flicker, and fade out.</i>]<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%> <h2>Scene 2: Epilogue</h2><br>
Note: The audience might presume that the hanging marks the end of the play. However they will shut up when the spotlight comes on.<br>
<br>
Spotlight: JOHN hangs dead; the rope creaks slightly as he swings back and forth, gently now. Broaden the light. The CAT sits looking up at the corpse, meows mournfully. Broaden the light a little further: The CAT sits by its feeding bowl, meows again.<br>
