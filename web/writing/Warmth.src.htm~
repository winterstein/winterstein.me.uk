“Let&quot;s go somewhere indoors.” He said, “I&quot;m getting cold.”<br>
“I&quot;ve gotta finish this drink.” I replied, “For the past half an hour I&quot;ve had a strong urge just to throw the glass into the river and it&quot;s only the thought of the wine in it that&quot;s stopped me.”<br>
That touched his sense of right and wrong, so we paused for a minute whilst I emptied the glass in front of me. It was a shot-an&quot;-a-mixer glass from the bar, half full of cheap red wine. Jacob&quot;s Creek, 1995; a good year, but a fucking shit vineyard. I gulped it down anyway, then hefted the glass out over the water. It was swallowed instantly by the darkness. I waited, constantly expecting a splash as it landed. The splash didn&quot;t come. And didn&quot;t come, for microseconds that were definitely too long. Finally there was a crash and tinkle as the glass impacted on one of the punts moored on the other side of the river. We pictured glass shards spitting across the unused punt, laughed and left.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was long past midnight then. I don&quot;t know what time it was beyond late, but I&quot;d spent midnight fencing with juggling clubs. Cut and thrust, parry and lunge. Spirit flowing, back and forth along the path and on the grass, shouting swashbuckling things and aiming my blows. Until my friend hacked a heavy handed parry in too hard and too accurate, and snapped the club. Olly hadn&quot;t joined in, but slipped off quietly to brood. Good friend that I was, I hadn&quot;t noticed. I would have missed him completely if it hadn&quot;t been for the broken club. It wasn&quot;t mine, or the friend I&quot;d been ‘fighting&quot; with, but another friend who hadn&quot;t approved from the beginning of his juggling clubs being put to such uses. So (my attempts at surreptitious super-glue repairs having failed) we had to apologise, look sufficiently guilty for the requisite amount of time, and promise to replace the broken club. The guilty look kept me in the room long enough to connect with Olly again.<br>
He walked in self-consciously down, like the world was on his shoulders, and had invited some other heavy celestial orbs round for the night. Olly is a little younger than me, but with about the same level of tarnish. He projects better, or at least further; in this case depression. When he said he was going to sit by the river, I thought it wise to join him. Just in case he felt like doing something more active and jumping in it. If he&quot;d thought it through properly perhaps he would of. The river was infamously shallow near us. Wide and picturesque but shallow. A suicide attempt would only result in muddy jeans and a ruined T-shirt; a gloriously ironic finale. However, either the mood left him or he just wanted the extra air down there. Perspective is important, and a cold clear atmosphere can do wonders. It didn&quot;t though, not this time.<br>
There is a heaviness which comes sometimes, a feeling of weightlessness but far too much mass. He smiled ruefully. A lost misfit. If only such misfits could reject society&quot;s targets as well as society&quot;s methods. But no, we all end up jumping through the same hoops, just to show ‘them&quot; that we could have done it. So, leave the straight and narrow, dare to shout, and laugh and live, but make sure you still get a girlfriend, a good salary, a decent car. Success is always measured in standard issue terms. Personal terms are cut to fit.<br>
“I just want someone.” he says, legs dangling over the river wall, and again later in my room, “Someone to want me.”<br>
“Don&quot;t worry about it, it&quot;ll happen.” I repeat, “And anyway, having a girl isn&quot;t the be-all and end-all of things, it just opens up a whole new set of insecurities to get fucked up about.”<br>
He looks glum, I spout other trite but unhelpful truths. The blood red wine is tasting better, but Olly refuses to drink. He did have a five pint head-start to start with and it&quot;s clearly weighing him down. His face moves reluctantly like his belly is rolling ponderously after it. He knows this black mood is unhelpful, knows there&quot;s nothing to be done tonight. He can&quot;t be temporarily happy though; he&quot;s done that too long. I try to connect, but it&quot;s a hit and miss affair. Now and then I hit on something, and he leans out of his chair to agree, interrupting the downward flow of the music. Nothing I say really helps, though trying is important: “You know the people who love you,” I tell him, “And you need two hands to count them. You know that.”<br>
It doesn&quot;t alter his mood. There isn&quot;t really anything I can say to help, no magic wand I can wave to solve his problems, which go beyond a girl for the night.<br>
“Goodnight.” he says. Tomorrow he&quot;ll be smiling and won&quot;t mention this, or will do so only to say how silly he was. The pain remains though, but it would be too embarrassing to own to it by day. There&quot;s nothing I can do for him though. Nothing.<br>
He walks out. I wait for a splash but it doesn&quot;t come.<br>
