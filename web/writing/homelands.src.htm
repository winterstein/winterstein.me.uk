<!-- <h2>Homelands: An incident</h2> -->
NARRATOR: A town street at dusk. By the fading light, two children play a game of street cricket with a cardboard box for stumps. A car comes racing around the bend. One child is silhouetted by the headlights, arm upraised as he bowls the ball. There is a squeal of brakes.<br>
<br>
PASSENGER: Shit. What the hell? Something just came flying at me, and - <br>
DRIVER: [hysterical] Oh my god, oh my god.<br>
PASSENGER: Calm down. What happenned?<br>
DRIVER: I think we might have hit someone. oh god.<br>
PASSENGER: Shit.<br>
DRIVER: Get out and look.<br>
[The passenger gives him a dirty look to say 'why me?', but climbs out]<br>
PASSENGER: It's a boy. About 12 perhaps. He's unconscious, and bleeding pretty bad.<br>
DRIVER: God forgive me. What do we do?<br>
PASSENGER: What do you mean? We have to get him to hospital, or call an ambulance. Shit. How fast were you going?<br>
DRIVER: I - I don't know.<br>
PASSENGER: Ah, I told you not to drive so fucking fast.<br>
DRIVER: I wasn't going that fast. They were in the middle of the road. What the hell were they doing in the road?<br>
PASSENGER: They?<br>
DRIVER: I think - I think there were two of them.<br>
PASSENGER: Well there's only one here now.<br>
DRIVER: What are you doing?<br>
PASSENGER: I've got a mobile phone in my jacket. Just a minute...<br>
<br>
[ARAB 1 runs in]<br>
ARAB 1: Ahalan! [arabic for hello]<br>
PASSENGER: What'd you say?<br>
ARAB 1: Aih! [goes to the boy's side] Hamdi, Hamdi.<br>
PASSENGER: I'm calling an ambulance now.<br>
ARAB 1: What the hell were you doing?<br>
DRIVER: I'm sorry.<br>
PASSENGER: He's still alive, if we get him to a hospital he might be OK.<br>
ARAB 1: He's dead.<br>
DRIVER: How do you know? You're not a doctor.<br>
ARAB 1: He's not breathing.<br>
DRIVER: I'm sorry.<br>
ARAB 1: What good does that do? This is my cousin. This is my cousin you've killed.<br>
DRIVER: We didn't mean to.<br>

ARAB 1: Yes, but what is the life of a palestinian boy to you? [to the
dead boy] Hamdi, ma'assalama bismillar, go in peace with Allah. [to the DRIVER] Cus! He was just an arab, right, who cares?<br>

PASSENGER: That's not true. It was an accident. A terrible accident. Look, I'm going to call the police and report it.<br>
ARAB 1: You hit him like he was an animal - and you probably would have left him for roadkill if I hadn't caught you. Elif air ab tizak! [1,000 dicks in your arse]<br>
<br>
NARRATOR: More arabs gather.<br>
<br>
ARAB 2: What's going on?<br>
ARAB 1: Two israelis killed my cousin Hamdi.<br>
ARAB 2: Fucking bastards.<br>
ARAB 1: He was just a boy. Thirteen<br>
ARAB 2: The Jews don't care. They'll kill anyone.<br>
ARAB 1: We have them here.<br>
ARAB 2: Murderers!<br>
PASSENGER: It was an accident! We tried to stop.<br>
ARAB 2: Every time you kill an arab, you just say 'it was an accident'. You shoot our people every day - every day another victim.<br>
DRIVER: He was in the middle of the road. Shit - He had his arm up throwing a stone. He was trying to hit us. You saw it right?<br>
PASSENGER: That thing that came flying at me - yes.<br>
DRIVER: They were in the road, attacking us!<br>
PASSENGER: Shit, it might not even have been a stone. It could have been a grenade or anything.<br>
DRIVER: The boy was a terrorist! Both of them.<br>
PASSENGER: And you braked.<br>
DRIVER: Yes I braked, it was a reflex.<br>
<br>

PASSENGER: I told you we should carry guns.<br>
DRIVER: They're going to kill us.<br>
PASSENGER: Start the engine, let's get out of here.<br>
<br>
ARAB 1: What's that? The bastards are trying to get away.<br>
ARAB 2: They want to run us all over. Murderers.<br>
ARAB 1: We'll see about that.<br>
<br>
NARRATOR: An army jeep arrives, fires a warning shot into the air.<br>
<br>
SOLDIER: [gun drawn] Back off! [fires another shot into the air] I mean it. Get lost, all of you!<br>
DRIVER: Thank god.<br>
SOLDIER: What happenned?<br>
PASSENGER: Some boys set up an ambush. Threw some bomb they'd made at us. We hit one, and the arabs all came running. They were about to kill us.<br>
