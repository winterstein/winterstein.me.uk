(3)<br>
Joshua opened the house door and picked up the mail. There were several letters scattered on the hall floor.<br>
"Ah, you're back?" a voice called out from another room.<br>
The speaker appeared and leant in a door way; casual-cool, with the right play of light and shadow across his face.<br>
"Yeah. How are you Derrick?" <br>
Derrick waved his free hand vaguely, "I've got a bit of the flu."<br>
Joshua was concerned but puzzled. "You look fine," he said.<br>
Derrick did indeed look perfectly healthy, as well as defiantly handsome in a red and black T-shirt, but his hung head and aggressively slumped shoulders radiated depression.<br>
"Yes, but there're only two answers an Englishman can give to the question 'How are you?', namely 'Fine' or 'I've got a bit of the flu', so, I've got a bit of the flu."<br>
"What's wrong?"<br>
"This town. It's so dead. All these boring people around me. I feel all caged up by safe and prissy responses. There are too many too normal people. They get scared by anything exciting. Freaked out by us freaks, but there aren't enough freaks."<br>
Derrick continued for a while in a dull tone. When he stopped there was a silence. He knew this depression was a vicious circle, but couldn't break it. The people he met just weren't interesting enough. The things they considered so important he saw as shallow and beneath him. This he accepted as natural, yet he saw such a constantly negative attitude was itself hollow and worthless. He was disillusioned with disillusionment, knew that even that was a cliché, and longed to break out. If he could find the right set of people - talented people with ideas and style - there was no limit to what they could do. He dreamed of starting a loose commune of friends. A group of people like himself - creative and alive - who would write and make music and show this town how to really have fun. He started again on a different topic. "I've written a new story." he told Josh.<br>
"Oh, what about?"<br>
"It's a vignette, a collection of snapshots of a jazz band on tour. They're structured around a jazz song - 'Heart Attack and Vine' by Tom Waits, a really great song, definitely on the weird side of jazz and blues. I must've played it to you. I've tried to work the rhythm of the song into the rhythm of the words. It ends with the last line of the song: 'Well this stuff'll probably kill you, let's do another line.' I'll give you a copy to read."<br>
"Sure"<br>
"Are you writing anything these days?"<br>
It was a friendly enough question, and asked without the pressure of genuine interest, but it made Josh tense. "I'm working on a short spelling mistake." was all he could reply. He then shifted from the wall and headed off in the direction of his room.<br>
He needs to loosen up, Derrick thought as he wandered into the kitchen and helped himself to someone's orange juice. He rolled his new story over in his mind. Yes, it was good. Nicely ironic and self referential. A little derivative, but only if you'd read the right books, and the right books were pretty obscure. It needed a title still. 'Vindication', he thought would be a nice word to use. Yes it sounded powerful. Although perhaps something French would be better.<br>
