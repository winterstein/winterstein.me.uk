Sailing
-------

Do not attempt to steer
The currents are stronger than you
Do not plot a course; You
Will not reach that destination
Anyway
Why not throw away your maps?
Where you're going is not on them
Only raise the sails high to catch the wind
Whatever wind
And do not spoil the starry night
Trying to navigate
