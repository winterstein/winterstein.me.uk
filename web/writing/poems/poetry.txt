	The Healing
	-----------
Somehow
the wound became septic
though where the germs came from
we avoided asking
and it resisted all treatment
festering

Then spring brought new life
blind white things that
stirred, wriggled, writhed
and fed, and fed

The flowing of flesh
a transfer of power
under bandages, wraps
and the smell of decay

Until something escaped
out of bandages, wraps
and smell of decay
looped the loop once
then flew away

Sailing
-------
Do not attempt to steer
The currents are stronger than you
Do not plot a course; You
Will not reach that destination
Anyway
Why not throw away your maps?
Where you're going is not on them
Only raise the sails high to catch the wind
Whatever wind
And do not spoil the starry nights
Trying to navigate








Instructions in the Event of Fire
---------------------------------
Alert the authorities
   It is their responsibility
Shout Fire
(well done citizen)
If the right appliances are available
Consider fighting the fire DO NOT
JEOPARDISE YOUR OWN SAFETY
Do not re-enter the building for others
Assemble out of harms way in 
an ordely fashion
It's not your problem
Go back to bed

Ode to a Friend
---------------
As a stranger on a dark night
One of the lost in search of light
A piece of driftwood thrown high by the sea
A climber resting at the peak
Or a pilgrim in prayer
As a suitor, a friend, a visitor from distant lands
As a spectator, on tiptoe and leaning over the crowd
Or a tramp seeking a warm corner
Out of breath (it must be the altitude)
I come to your door again







Late Nights
-----------
Rub your eyes three times and remember
Those immortal evenings
When we kicked open the windows of the night
Poured wine on distance and time
And in the soft glow of superiority
Surveyed our deserted kingdom

One of those velvet evenings when friendship
condensed, became liquid
Like vodka cut with sunlight
So that we didn't notice when the drink ran out
But swore an unspoken oath of loyalty
   To each other
   To ourselves
   To that night





Lost In Transit
---------------
In arrivals around the world
We are born again
On planes and trains and dusty buses
Only you remained constant
Floating through airport lounges
Your face frozen against
A blurred asian landscape
No wonder small things got magnified
We were close once, but
Something got lost in transit







Last Poem
---------
Destroy this poem
Throw it away
Throw it all away
Burn the paper and scatter the ashes
Erase even the memory

No more! the words protest
But with some pity:
  We gave you your chance
  We wanted you to shine
  We were on your side
But now it's enough

Humbler and wiser I shall seek
To reconcile myself to smaller horizons
Become a banker. Get an office, a middle-aged girl
No longer raise my eyes to the mountains
Or waste hours gazing at the sky
For I no longer desire the poet's pen
the poet's eye
I give it up 

Let this be my last
Let these clumsy words suffice
Take them and bury them deep
With no stately funeral
No monument but this full stop
