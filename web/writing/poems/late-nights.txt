Late Nights
-----------

Rub your eyes three times and remember
Those immortal evenings
When we kicked open the windows of the night
Poured wine on distance and time
And in the soft glow of superiority
Surveyed our deserted kingdom

Those velvet evenings when friendship
condensed, became liquid
Like vodka cut with sunlight
So that we didn't notice when the drink ran out
But swore an unspoken oath of loyalty
   To each other
   To ourselves
   To that night
