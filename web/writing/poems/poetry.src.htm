&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Healing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------<br>
Somehow<br>
the wound became septic<br>
though where the germs came from<br>
we avoided asking<br>
and it resisted all treatment<br>
festering<br>
<br>
Then spring brought new life<br>
blind white things that<br>
stirred, wriggled, writhed<br>
and fed, and fed<br>
<br>
The flowing of flesh<br>
a transfer of power<br>
under bandages, wraps<br>
and the smell of decay<br>
<br>
Until something escaped<br>
out of bandages, wraps<br>
and smell of decay<br>
looped the loop once<br>
then flew away<br>

Sailing<br>
-------<br>
Do not attempt to steer<br>
The currents are stronger than you<br>
Do not plot a course; You<br>
Will not reach that destination<br>
Anyway<br>
Why not throw away your maps?<br>
Where you're going is not on them<br>
Only raise the sails high to catch the wind<br>
Whatever wind<br>
And do not spoil the starry nights<br>
Trying to navigate<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Falling<br>
-------<br>
i fell; swallowed<br>
like a pebble in the ocean<br>
seamlessly<br>
<br>

Instructions in the Event of Fire<br>
---------------------------------<br>
Alert the authorities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is their responsibility<br>
Shout Fire<br>
(well done citizen)<br>
If the right appliances are available<br>
Consider fighting the fire DO NOT<br>
JEOPARDISE YOUR OWN SAFETY<br>
Do not re-enter the building for others<br>
Assemble out of harms way in <br>
an ordely fashion<br>
It's not your problem<br>
Go back to bed<br>
<br>
(this notice to be displayed in all rooms)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=friend>
<br>
<br>
Ode to a Friend<br>
---------------<br>
As a stranger on a dark night<br>
One of the lost in search of light<br>
A piece of driftwood thrown high by the sea<br>
A climber resting at the peak<br>
Or a pilgrim in prayer<br>
As a suitor, a friend, a visitor from distant lands<br>
As a spectator, on tiptoe and leaning over the crowd<br>
Or a tramp seeking a warm corner<br>
Out of breath (it must be the altitude)<br>
I come to your door again<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Late Nights<br>
-----------<br>
Rub your eyes three times and remember<br>
Those immortal evenings<br>
When we kicked open the windows of the night<br>
Poured wine on distance and time<br>
And in laughter, music and candlelight<br>
Mapped our future kingdoms<br>
<br>
One of those velvet evenings when friendship<br>
condensed, became liquid<br>
Like vodka cut with sunlight<br>
So that we didn't notice when the drink ran out<br>
But swore an unspoken oath of loyalty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To each other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To that night<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Lost In Transit<br>
---------------<br>
In arrivals around the world<br>
We are born again<br>
On planes and trains and dusty buses<br>
Only you remained constant<br>
Floating through airport lounges<br>
Your face frozen against<br>
A blurred asian landscape<br>
No wonder small things got magnified<br>
We were close once, but<br>
Something got lost in transit<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Apparently you can't turn back time,<br>
Though I do not approve and am not resigned.<br>
The inevitable has little to commend it,<br>
And in acquiescing do we not become<br>
Collaborators?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Last Poem<br>
---------<br>
Destroy this poem<br>
Throw it away<br>
Throw it all away<br>
Burn the paper and scatter the ashes<br>
Erase even the memory<br>
<br>
No more! the words protest<br>
But with some pity:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We gave you your chance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted you to shine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We were on your side<br>
But now it's enough<br>
<br>
Humbler and wiser I shall seek<br>
To reconcile myself to smaller horizons<br>
Become a banker. Get an office, a middle-aged girl<br>
No longer raise my eyes to the mountains<br>
Or waste hours gazing at the sky<br>
For I no longer desire the poet's pen<br>
the poet's eye<br>
I give it up <br>
<br>
Let this be my last<br>
Let these clumsy words suffice<br>
Take them and bury them deep<br>
With no stately funeral<br>
No monument but this full stop<br>
<br>
