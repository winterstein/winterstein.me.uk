Destroy this poem
Throw it away
Throw it all away
Burn the paper and scatter the ashes
Erase even the memory

No more! the words protest
But with some pity:
  We gave you your chance
  We wanted you to shine
  We were on your side
But now it's enough

Humbler and wiser I shall seek
To reconcile myself to smaller horizons
Become a banker. Get an office, a middle-aged girl
No longer raise my eyes to the mountains
Or waste hours gazing at the sky
For I no longer desire the poet's pen
the poet's eye
I give it up 

Let this be my last
Let these clumsy words suffice
Take them and bury them deep
With no stately funeral
No monument but this full stop.
