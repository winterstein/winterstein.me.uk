Infestation
-----------

The heart-worm is not actually a worm,
 but a type of noxious beetle, 
  that lives off the human heart.
Black chitinous bugs, feeding on the heart,
6 legs scrabbling, hard to kill,
like slimy burrowing cockroaches.
Feeding, laying their eggs
on the weakening heart.

One symptom of infestation
 is a longing to cut open the chest,
  to peel open the flesh like a surgeon,
   & let them run out.
My right hand quivers for the knife,
Grim temptation; let them out.

When I die cremate my body.
