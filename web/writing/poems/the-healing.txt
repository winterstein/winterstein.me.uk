	The Healing
	-----------

Somehow
the wound became septic
though where the germs came from
we avoided asking
and it resisted all treatment
festering

Then spring brought new life
blind white things that
stirred, wriggled, writhed
and fed, and fed

The flowing of flesh
a transfer of power
under bandages, wraps
and the smell of decay

Until something escaped
out of bandages, wraps
and smell of decay
looped the loop once
then flew away
