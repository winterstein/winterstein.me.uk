Another Hangover
----------------

The cold and the coffee
And the choking feeling when she looks at me
The disappointment in your face
And the nights without sleep
I will take these things and use them
And wind my spring within with them
SO I do my mechanical dance again

Above all, the coffee
Above all the beer, coffee
Beer on coffee and back again
Adding as needed
Keeping the balance
Between lost and aware I float
And I will stay there
Until the scales break. Buckle
Under the weight of too much life
These things you call stretching may snap me
