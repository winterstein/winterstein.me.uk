Lost In Transit
---------------

In arrivals around the world
We are born again
On planes and trains and dusty buses
Only you remained constant
Floating through airport lounges
Your face frozen against
A blurred asian landscape
No wonder small things got magnified
We were close once, 
but something got 
lost in transit
