Life's Dirty Little Secret
--------------------------

Whatever happens, keep breathing
This is the deepest knowledge
Even the dumbest men agree with it
Even men of the highest character
Are stained by it

But I am ridiculous
My time passed, my promise faded

& this cheap hanging on but blights
what came before, 
like a goodbye that drags on too long
becomes awkward, embarassing

The saint shits in his bed, made 
incontinent by age
To his nurses, he is not a saint but
a man who shits in his bed
which they have to clean

These I know
are problems for tomorrow
For now: keep breathing
The knowledge lies deep, 
beyond the reach of books or ideals
It's stored down in the DNA
What about beauty, justice or love, I say
the nobility of man?
Whatever, the genes reply,
Just keep breathing
