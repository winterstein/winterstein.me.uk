dog-god
-------

Is the god of dogs doglike?
Does He sit up & beg, roll over, play dead
& dream of chasing omnipresent rabbits?
(the heretics say He has fleas,
but don't listen to such talk for
sake of your canine soul)
Dare we imagine the table leg He humps?
Or Whose slippers He carries?
His howl the dread sound that calls
each & every dog to account
He - or She?
In the beginning
- so the buried holy bones say - 
In the beginning was the bitch in heat.
