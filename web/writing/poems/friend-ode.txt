Ode to a Friend
---------------

As a stranger on a dark night
One of the lost in search of light
A piece of driftwood thrown high by the sea
A climber resting at the peak
Or a pilgrim in prayer
As a suitor, a friend, a visitor from distant lands
As a spectator, on tiptoe and leaning over the crowd
Or a tramp seeking a warm corner
Out of breath (it must be the altitude)
I come to your door again
