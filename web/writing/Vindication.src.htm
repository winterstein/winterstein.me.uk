Joshua, an obvious student, sighed and drank deeply from the pint glass in front of him. This was in East Anglia in 1997, a year of change without change, in politics and elsewhere. More specifically, he was drinking in a fake Irish pub in the university town of Cambridge. The place was called O'Quinns, showing a certain lack of research by the management, and was decorated mainly with&nbsp;&nbsp;Guinness adds bought wholesale. He left the drink temporarily in order to sigh again, "You know that short story I was working on?" <br>
His companion, a refined black woman called Nancy, shook her head. She'd known him long enough to recognise how he phrased things, and realised this was probably the first he'd said to anyone on the subject.<br>
"It's about a Greek shepherd sitting under a tree drinking on the job. As his sheep wander off and he gradually passes out, he tells the tree about his life and the girls he has lost."<br>
Nancy nodded promptly, not wishing to provoke further details. She would no doubt have to read it sooner or later.<br>
"Anyway," Joshua said, "I finished it last night"<br>
"Couldn't sleep." he added with a shrug. It was true; he'd drunk about a dozen coffees sitting by the word processor. Each one going cold before it could be finished.<br>
"Did you manage to work any scenes from your love life in?"<br>
"Of course. With only minor rewriting to make them fit, but then this is fiction. I'm allowed to get the girl."<br>
"Happy ending?"<br>
"No. That would be a sell out."<br>
"So?"<br>
"So no-one's buying. And speaking of your round..."<br>
"I'm on it," she replied, rising from her chair and pretending to scan a distant horizon, "If I'm not back in ten minutes... just wait longer."<br>
"Take your time, just get whoever he is to buy me a drink as well. Something with a paper parasol, cherries and much vodka for preference."<br>
Nancy went and he was left to fidget with the beer mats. 70% of clowns never fall in love, they told him. He fished a biro out of his pocket but couldn't find enough white space to doodle on and settled for colouring alternate words blue. The job complete, he pulled a sheaf of papers from the inside pocket of his jacket, unfolded them and placed them on the table. The typed black words seemed to jar now against the paper. There was a Bob Dylan line, what was it? "Do not create anything. It will be misunderstood. It will not change. It will follow you." Probably sounded better with harmonica. Somewhat self-consciously he tried to straighten the creases out of the papers, failed, and even more self-consciously gave up.<br>
"Ah, the latest masterpiece."<br>
Nancy had returned with the drinks. She passed his over and sat down.<br>
"May I?" she gestured, then accepted the story. 'The Difference Between Sheep and Goats' the title said in imitation typewriter font.<br>
"Working title only," he explained.<br>
It wasn't bad. Nothing deep, new, or particularly moving, but it was loose and enjoyable. She was onto the third page, and impressed though hiding it carefully, when a gangly man pulled up a chair and dropped into it.<br>
"Hey Joshua, my man, what's up? How's it hanging bro?"<br>
Joshua allowed his gaze to take in the newcomer's smartly creased trousers, chromatically offensive but undeniably neat shirt and tie and downright aryan face before settling on a withering look.<br>
"I keep forgetting you had an education," the newcomer switched styles fluently, "I was merely enquiring into your current state, mentally, physically, fiscally and spiritually."<br>
"Mental state: Latin American - repressed and unstable. The others... poor, very poor and let's just say I'm off the Pope's Christmas card list this year. So, same as ever. How about you? Since you got a real job ("-paid job-") and moved out, you don't call, you don't write?"<br>
"Well, the art movie business is abstract these days." Mark made a frame of his fingers and squinted through it at his friend, "Abstract and moody, wouldn't you agree Nancy?"<br>
"Hello Mark," she replied whilst Josh subtly retrieved his work and slipped it back inside his coat.<br>
"And look at you!" he said turning back to Mark, "They don't feed you properly either."<br>
It was an old joke between them.<br>
"Your neither female nor Jewish, so enough of the Jewish mother already." Nancy cut in.<br>
In this way their evening ran its course along oft trodden paths. Predictable, but comforting because of it.<br>
<br>
"The human body's a marvel of engineering and we don't realise it," Josh said, "We're impressed when we see a bloody Porsche but that's nothing compared to you or me."<br>
It was close to last orders now and the pub was warm and full. He was talking to or rather at Mark. Nancy had gone to get the next round. Mark had followed her progress through the crowd around the bar rather than the conversation. He was considering leaving Josh for a moment and giving her a hand.<br>
"Or grannies, or that ugly bugger who presents kid's TV, what's his name?" Josh continued, waving a beer bottle to illustrate his point, "...and, And trees."<br>
"Have you ever been in love?" Mark cut in. Josh blinked sharply; he hadn't realised it was that late already. "Not outside of licensing hours, no." he replied.<br>
At closing time, Joshua suggested they return to his house. Mark spun an empty glass with his left hand. "I hate to be responsible," he said turning to Nancy, "But we ought to get some sleep."<br>
"Big shoot tomorrow." he added in reply to Joshua's enquiring look, "Careers to mess up, and so on."<br>
"Oh? What's the film?"<br>
"A wildlife documentary. The natural world from dawn to dusk, that kind of thing. Except, we're shooting in a supermarket."<br>

Early morning half light hung over the aisles. A few shoppers browsed slowly. Others in smart dress and clearly pressed for time, zipped straight to the things they needed. The supermarket was mostly quiet. Although the silence was frequently cut, the noises were solitary and personal. A mother and a businessman wandered in opposite directions down the dairy produce. She looked tired. Especially in comparison to her child, a brightly dressed girl who ran to and fro bringing yoghurts and chocolate mousses to be rejected. The man strolled, examined products for ingredients, compared others for price and in the end chose nothing from that aisle. Neither of them looked at the other, although the man smiled briefly at the child.<br>
Nancy looked up from the lens. The camera sat in a trolley hidden by biscuits, bread and frozen peas. She grinned warmly up at Mark and laughed lightly, "Equal parts wonderful and ridiculous."<br>
She was wearing a sky blue cotton dress with her long black hair tied back. Mark tried not to look at her too often. The dress was simple but flattering, drawn in nicely at the waist. It was a style she normally avoided, which Mark thought a shame. She said it made her feel fat. The aisles quickly filled up. By noon, the store was comfortably full, with shoppers of all types milling together under the harsh neon lights. The sounds of consistent commerce filled the air. The soft rumble of trolleys, rustle of goods picked up, goods put down, and the ringing of cash registers. The store would continue to steadily fill from now until six o'clock. Shooting from the shopping trolley no longer gave clear views down the aisles, only blurred shots of people passing. Mark had started doing quick aerial shots by standing on chairs the store manager produced for them. It meant exposing the camera, which inevitably got people's attention. <br>
"Damn it," Nancy remarked, "We can't pull a camera out and film without distracting people from doing the everyday thing that we want to film."<br>
Mark nodded, but he was more surprised by how little attention people paid them. Their behaviour was clearly odd - when not openly filming they were standing bent over a shopping trolley for several minutes. People noticed of course, but no-one actually stopped and asked what they were doing. Instead the curious looks were often followed by averted looks, embarrassed at having been curious. He wondered whether these people would look good on film or spoil the shots. She smiled his way again and he felt himself smiling back with his whole body. He was pretty sure it was love he felt for her, although it had built up gradually. Perhaps that was why he couldn't tell her. He'd wanted to many times recently, but the closest he'd ever got to confessing his feelings was quoting Prufrock in her birthday card. There had been signs that Nancy also entertained romantic feelings towards him, but he had analysed these endlessly until he no longer knew what anything meant. Telling her could spoil everything. He told himself it was better to wait, and if anything was meant to happen it would. He repeated this to himself like a mantra.<br>
Around them, people went about their daily business. Dinners were bought, alond with packed lunches and holiday suppliesOld ladies did their weekly shopping, congregating in corners of the supermarket for little chats. Two kids pushing shopping trolleys happily collided with each other. Phlegmatic staff circulated stacking the shelves as they emptied. An irate middle aged man in a union jack jumper complained at a woman in a blue uniform. She was smiling and trying to be helpful; he was demanding his rights. A young couple went down the aisles holding hands. A bored housewife looked after them wistfully. The checkout staff called to each other across the queues swapping jokes and gossip. They had codewords for insulting different types of rude customer.<br>

Joshua opened the house door and picked up the mail. There were several letters scattered on the hall floor.<br>
"Ah, you're back?" a voice called out from another room.<br>
The speaker appeared and leant in a door way; casual-cool, with the right play of light and shadow across his face.<br>
"Yeah. How are you Derrick?" <br>
Derrick waved his free hand vaguely, "I've got a bit of the flu."<br>
Joshua was concerned but puzzled. "You look fine," he said.<br>
Derrick did indeed look perfectly healthy, as well as defiantly handsome in a red and black T-shirt, but his hung head and aggressively slumped shoulders radiated depression.<br>
"Yes, but there're only two answers an Englishman can give to the question 'How are you?', namely 'Fine' or 'I've got a bit of the flu', so, I've got a bit of the flu."<br>
"What's wrong?"<br>
"This town. It's so dead. All these boring people around me. I feel all caged up by safe and prissy responses. There are too many too normal people. They get scared by anything exciting. Freaked out by us freaks, but there aren't enough freaks."<br>
Derrick continued for a while in a dull tone. When he stopped there was a silence. He knew this depression was a vicious circle, but couldn't break it. The people he met just weren't interesting enough. The things they considered so important he saw as shallow and beneath him. This he accepted as natural, yet he saw such a constantly negative attitude was itself hollow and worthless. He was disillusioned with disillusionment, knew that even that was a cliché, and longed to break out. If he could find the right set of people - talented people with ideas and style - there was no limit to what they could do. He dreamed of starting a loose commune of friends. A group of people like himself - creative and alive - who would write and make music and show this town how to really have fun. He started again on a different topic. "I've written a new story." he told Josh.<br>
"Oh, what about?"<br>
"It's a vignette, a collection of snapshots of a jazz band on tour. They're structured around a jazz song - 'Heart Attack and Vine' by Tom Waits, a really great song, definitely on the weird side of jazz and blues. I must've played it to you. I've tried to work the rhythm of the song into the rhythm of the words. It ends with the last line of the song: 'Well this stuff'll probably kill you, let's do another line.' I'll give you a copy to read."<br>
"Sure"<br>
"Are you writing anything these days?"<br>
It was a friendly enough question, and asked without the pressure of genuine interest, but it made Josh tense. "I'm working on a short spelling mistake." was all he could reply. He then shifted from the wall and headed off in the direction of his room.<br>
He needs to loosen up, Derrick thought as he wandered into the kitchen and helped himself to someone's orange juice. He rolled his new story over in his mind. Yes, it was good. Nicely ironic and self referential. A little derivative, but only if you'd read the right books, and the right books were pretty obscure. It needed a title still. 'Vindication', he thought would be a nice word to use. Yes it sounded powerful. Although perhaps something French would be better.<br>

He opened the envelopes carelessly and tossed a pizza ad and a bank statement into the bin unread, but stopped at the third letter. The address was hand-written, but formal. He had a reasonable idea what it contained. Nancy thought she was the only person he'd shown his story to, but he had in fact entered it in a magazine writing competition. The winning entry would be published in a couple of editions time. There was also some prize money but he had forgotten how much. This would be the reply. <br>
He was in no hurry to open it. His feelings towards his work normally swung between embarrassment and surprise that it wasn't as bad as he remembered. Now that he held the letter however, he felt certain it was a rejection. 'Thank you for your story, but...', and there was always a but. The thought of losing did not bother him. He knew there were many better writers than him out there. It was the thought of being judged on his work that he disliked. That he had sat down, put pen to paper and let his thoughts flow, and now others would read this, find faults and pass judgement. That he had signed his name to a few sheets of scrappy sentences which would be passed around and criticised where he couldn't defend them. Worse, he couldn't deny them anymore. Nor were there any ulterior motives he could claim as excuses. Before writing, his head had swirled with a thousand stories. Glorious tales that would bring laughter and tears to the reader. Something that would reach out and, in simple clear words, touch other people with the beauty of the world. Now that he had produced a story it clearly did no such thing. He wished he had never written it. It was a lot easier being judged only by his potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
So he delayed opening the letter for as long as possible. Mark had dropped round earlier on with an advance copy of the supermarket film, and he elected to watch that first, then further delayed things by making popcorn and fixing himself a drink. Procrastination is never done, and he could be infinitely creative when it came to avoiding things. The video slipped into the machine with a quite mechanised whirr. Josh's drop into the house's dirty red sofa was not nearly as evocative of precision engineering. He unearthed the remote from beneath a discarded t-shirt, pushed a couple of buttons, and settled himself in to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
It was good. Mark had a natural talent for camera shots that let the idea work when it could very easily have failed. The shoppers milled around, looking like cattle, yet at the same time very human. The way two till girls smiled at each other, or the older lady on the far checkout who tried to talk to each customer. It could have been him making that friendly hopeful smile. Or the man who pettily enforced the '5 items or less in this queue'. That could also have been him. The man threatening to write to the manager was eventually placated by a staff worker who then turned away with a worn out look on her face. Josh considered writing his own letter of complaint: 'Dear Sir, I was disgusted by the way one of your staff dealt with a customer. He was clearly in the wrong and should have been told to get lost, yet she was polite and patient...' <br>
Almost suddenly he felt infinitely weary. He curled up on the sofa and allowed his eyelids to slide shut. The letter slipped into a crack in the sofa. By the time he would wake from his nap he would have temporarily forgotten the letter, and it would have worked its way down into the springs. There was dust down there over a decade old. The next day he would look for it, but fail to find it. He would give up, and not have the courage to phone the organisers and ask about the competition. He fell asleep on the sofa, the TV-light flickering across his face, equal parts wonderful and ridiculous.<br>
The program ended with the last customers leaving. There was a close up shot of the store manager, slumping forward, his shoulders sagging, then visibly summoning the energy to do the locking up that still had to be done. Finally the lights were switched down and the last staff left as the credits rolled.<br>
