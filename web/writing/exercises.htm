<h1>Dialogue</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Write the dialogue for a scene without using any modifiers. Just write down a
conversation as it goes along naturally. After you have completed the
dialogue, add narrative description, but not dialogue tags such as said,
shouted or ordered. Instead, try to work the dialogue into the action as a
logical progression of the statements. Finally, add any dialogue tags that are
absolutely necessary, and keep them simple such as said, told, or asked.
Again, only put them in if you can find not other options. Compare this to the
previous dialogue you have written and see what you like or dislike about the
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a scene in which one person tells another person a story. Make sure
that you write it as a dialogue and not just a first person narrative, but
clearly have one person telling the story and the other person listening and
asking questions or making comments. The purpose of this scene will be both to
have the story stand alone as a subject, and to have the characters' reactions
to the story be the focal point of the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a scene in which one person is listening to two other people have an
argument or discussion. For example, a child listening to her parents argue
about money. Have the third character narrate the argument and explain what is
going on, but have the other two provide the entire dialogue. It is not
necessary to have the narrator understand the argument completely.
Miscommunication is a major aspect of dialogue.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a conversation between two liars. Give everything they say a double or
triple meaning. Never state or indicate through outside description that these
two people are lying. Let the reader figure it out strictly from the dialogue.
Try not to be obvious, such as having one person accuse the other of lying.
That is too easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a conversation in which no character speaks more than three words per
line of dialogue. Again, avoid crutches such as explaining everything they say
through narration. Use your narration to enhance the scene, not explain the
dialogue.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a narrative or scripted scene in which several characters are taking an
active role in the conversation. This can be a difficult aspect of dialogue to
master, because with each additional character, the reader or audience must be
able to keep track of the motivations and interests of the individuals
involved. This can be especially difficult in prose, where the time between
one character speaking and the next can be interrupted by action or
description. See how many characters your can sustain within the scene and
still have it make sense and be engaging.</p></li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h1>Writer's Resource Center</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Pick ten people you know and write a one-sentence description for each of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Record five minutes of a talk radio show. Write down the dialogue and add
narrative descriptions of the speakers and actions as if you were writing a
scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a 500-word biography of your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Write your obituary. List all of your life's accomplishments. You can write it
as if you died today or fifty or more years in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a 300-word description of your bedroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a fictional interview with yourself, an acquaintance, a famous figure or
a fictional character. Do it in the style of an appropriate (or inappropriate)
magazine or publication such as Time, People, Rolling Stone, Cosmopolitan,
Seventeen or Maxim.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick up a newspaper or supermarket tabloid. Scan the articles until you find
one that interests you and use it as the basis for a scene or story.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a diary of a fictional character.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a passage from a book, a favorite or a least favorite, and rewrite the passage in a different style such as noir, gothic romance, pulp fiction or horror story.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick an author, one you like though not necessarily your favorite, and make a list of what you like about the way they write. Do this from memory first, without rereading their work. After you've made your list, reread some of their work and see if you missed anything or if your answers change. Analyze what elements of their writing style you can add to your own, and what elements you should not or cannot add. Remember that your writing style is your own, and that you should only try to think of ways to add to your own style. Never try to mimic someone else for more than an exercise or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a piece of your writing that you have written in first person and
rewrite it in third person, or vice-versa. You can also try this exercise
changing tense, narrators, or other stylistic elements. Don't do this with an
entire book. Stick to shorter works. Once you commit to a style for a book,
never look back or you will spend all of your time rewriting instead of
writing. Try to identify your earliest childhood memory. Write down everything
you can remember about it. Rewrite it as a scene. You may choose to do this
from your current perspective or from the perspective you had at that age.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember an old argument you had with another person. Write about the
argument from the point of view of the other person. Remember that the idea is
to see the argument from their perspective, no your own. This is an exercise
in voice, not in proving yourself right or wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a 200-word description of a place. You can use any and all sensory
descriptions but sight: you can describe what it feels like, sounds like,
smells like and even tastes like. Try to write the description in such a way
that people will not miss the visual details.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit in a restaurant or a crowded area and write down the snippets of
conversation you hear. Listen to the people around you --- how they talk and
what words they use. Once you have done this, you can practice finishing their
conversations. Write your version of what comes next in the conversation.
Match their style.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a character from a story you have written or are in the process of
writing, then write a scene or multiple scenes in which that character
interacts with you, the author. One way to approach this exercise is to
write with the assumption that the character understands that you, as the
author, “created” him or her and are responsible for the things that
happened to them in the course of the story; another is to write as though
the character does not know these things and is simply interacting with the
author as just another person that he or she has met. For a bigger
challenge, do the exercise using a secondary or tertiary character from the
story (as opposed to the main protagonist).</p></li>
<li><p>Think of a situation in which a long-held fear or anxiety that you have
comes true (this should be a situation which could, but has not yet
happened). Now, using the third-person mode of narration, write a scene – or
a very short story – describing a fictional version of yourself dealing with
the situation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following exercises serve the purpose of encouraging the writer to think in
less conventional and stereotypical ways about how fictional characters’ actions
and motivations are linked – or not – to their appearance and cultural
backgrounds, with the overall aim of discouraging the reliance on archetype and
stereotype in character development.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With a partner, spend a few minutes “people watching” in a public place. Pick
a person you see and write a detailed physical description of that person.
Then write a quick “backstory” about that person – i.e., a quick synopsis of
their background, their personal and professional lives, etc., and then
imagine an interesting situation that person might find themselves in.
Meanwhile, your partner should do the same for a different person. When you’re
done, exchange either the physical descriptions or the backstories and then
write a scene or a short story using the elements that you now have. Does your
perception of how you might expect a character to behave change as a result of
the change in the character’s physical appearance and dress?</p></li>
<li><p>Our preconceptions of our own characters are heavily informed by conventions
of the cultural context, era, time and place, etc. that the story takes place
in. Rewrite a part of a short story you have written (usually one scene),
resetting the narrative in a different place and/or culture or a different
time in the place where it originally takes place (of course, this will not
always be feasible if the original story is heavily dependent on its own
historical/geographical context), using what you know about that place or
time. How did your perceptions of your characters change? What did you learn
about them? To what extent did the original narrative survive the
transposition?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Other exercises (prose style and language):</h1>

<p>These exercises are geared to encourage the student to think about his or her
approach to prose style and language. The purpose of the first two is to
encourage the writer to think about how the literature that he or she has read
influences their own writing, with the eventual goal of encouraging the writer
to develop his or her own aesthetic. The second two exercises encourage the
writer to consider his or her use of language in creative writing and both its
limitations and opportunities.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose one of your favorite piece of fiction (a short story or novel) and
write a new ending (the last page or two) in what you consider “your own”
prose style. How is the new ending different from the original? What
similarities remain?</p></li>
<li><p>Alternately, select a story you have written as well as a short story or
novel you have read in the past that deals with similar subject matter (the
similarities don’t have to be very close). Now, rewrite the ending of your
story in the prose style of the short story you’ve selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a scene of a short story (one or two pages) without using any
adjectives. How does your approach to description change when you are unable
to rely on traditional modes of description? What aesthetic choices does
that limitation encourage you to make?</p></li>
<li><p>Try to write one sentence (either descriptive or describing an action) more
than three hundred words in length (without using conjunctions). Now try to
write a scene of similar length using sentences that are no longer than six
words each. How did your use of language change as you shifted between these
modes of writing?</p></li>
<li><p>Synesthesia, according to M.H. Abrams in A Glossary of Literary Terms, is a
description of “one kind of sensation in terms of another; color is
attributed to sounds, odor to colors, sound to odors, and so on.” Here is an
example of synesthesia from Bruno Schulz’s Street of the Crocodiles: “Adela
would plunge the rooms into semidarkness by drawing down the linen blinds.
All colors immediately fell an octave lower [my italics] ; the room filled
with shadows, as if it had sunk to the bottom of the sea and the light was
reflected in mirrors of green water.” Schulz describes a change in color by
means of a musical term. Writers consciously and unconsciously employ this
peculiar method to convey the irreducible complexity of life onto the page.
Diane Ackerman (in A Natural History of the Senses) feels we are born with
this wonderful “intermingling” of senses: “A creamy blur of succulent blue
sounds smells like week-old strawberries dropped into a tin sieve as mother
approaches in a halo of color, chatter, and perfume like thick golden
butterscotch. Newborns ride on intermingling waves of sight, sound, touch,
taste, and, especially, smell.” Use synesthesia in a short
scene—surreptitiously, without drawing too much attention to it—to convey to
your reader an important understanding of some ineffable sensory experience.
Use “sight, sound, touch, taste, and, especially, smell.” 600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Déjà Vu. Write a 500-word sketch of a scene in which a character has an
experience that causes her to recall a startlingly similar past experience.
Juxtapose the two scenes, the present one and the past one, on top of each
other, writing, for instance, two or three sentences of the present moment,
then alternating back and forth between present and past that way. Show the
reader the remembered scene by use of Italics. Why would a character be
haunted like this? Think of a convincing reason for the déjà vu experience.
Or don’t worry too much about convincing reasons—just let some strange set
of events impinge on the present moment of your character. Be playful with
the relationship. Simple advice to beginners: don’t be heavy-handed. It’s
easier said than done, I know, but you can train yourself to relax and honor
your readers with difficult and unusual human patterns of behavior. Always
flatter your readers by proposing a complex and unexpected reality.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reluctant “I.” Write a 600-word first-person story in which you use the
first person pronoun (“I” or “me” or “my”) only two times—but keep the “I”
somehow important to the narrative you’re constructing. The point of this
exercise is to imagine a narrator who is less interested in himself or
herself than in what he or she is observing. You can make your narrator
someone who sees a very interesting event in which she is not necessarily a
participant. Or you can make him self-effacing yet a major participant in
the events related. The people we tend to like most are those who are much
more interested in other people than in themselves, selfless and caring,
whose conversation is not a stream of self-involved remarks (like the guy
who, after speaking about himself to a woman at a party for half an hour,
says, “Enough about me, what do you think of me?”). Another lesson you might
learn from this exercise is how important it is to let things and events
speak for themselves, beyond the ego of the narration. It is very important
in this exercise to make sure your reader is not surprised, forty or fifty
words into the piece, to realize that this is a first person narration. Show
us quickly who is observing the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Body English. Write a “conversation” in which no words are said. This
exercise is meant to challenge you to work with gesture, body language (or,
as a baseball announcer I heard once misspeak it, body English), all the
things we convey to each other without words. We often learn more about
characters in stories from the things characters do with their hands than
from what they say. It might be best to have some stranger observe this
conversation, rather than showing us the thoughts of one of the people
involved in the conversation, because the temptation to tell us what the
conversation is about is so great from inside the conversation. “I was doing
the opposite of Freud,” Desmond Morris says, of his famous book The Naked
Ape that first studied the ways humans speak with their bodies. “He listened
to people and didn’t watch; I watched people and didn’t listen.” Because of
Morris, according to Cassandra Jardine, “when politicians scratch their
noses they are now assumed to be lying—and the sight of the Queen [Elizabeth]
crossing her legs at the ankles is known to be a signal that her status is
too high for her to need to show sexual interest by crossing them further
up.” Autistic children cannot understand human conversation even when they
understand individual words because they cannot read facial expressions,
which is clear evidence of how important other forms of language are. 600
words.</p></li>
<li><p>The First Lie. Tape-record a conversation. It’s a tried and true method of
understanding how people talk, but still surprisingly effective. Obtain
permission of the people you are taping. Instruct your group each to tell
one small lie during the session, only one lie. Tell them, if they get
curious, that some philosophers think that deception was a crucial learned
behavior in the emergence of modern consciousness several thousand years
ago. You can participate in the conversation yourself, but don’t become an
interviewer. Let the machine run for a good long while, allowing your
friends to become comfortable and less aware of the tape recorder. Listen to
the tape a day or two later. Play it several times. Choose some small part
of the conversation to transcribe (the lies may be interesting, if you can
spot them, but more interesting should be all the other stuff they say).
Transcribe as faithfully as you can. Do not transcribe more than one page of
talk. After that, fill out the conversation with information about the
people who are speaking, giving us only details about them that we need to
know. The final product should be no longer than two pages long,
double-spaced.</p></li>
<li><p>Phone Tag. Write a fairly long, complicated phone conversation overheard by
someone in the room. All three people—the listener in the room, the caller,
and the person on the other end of the line—are involved with each other in
some way (not necessarily romantically). Let us hear the other end of the
conversation, without actually hearing it. This means you will be giving us
only one side of a conversation, so you will have to work to make the side
we’re hearing intriguing and capable of carrying a story. The listener in
the room can guess what the person on the other end of the line is saying,
but try to keep this guessing to a minimum, and make sure this guesswork is
done with integrity—well after the unheard speaker has spoken. 600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Underground History. Reread your own older fiction—one story or as many as
you want to. Find the ten most common words from this fiction (excluding
small and uninteresting words). Use these words as hidden titles for ten
paragraphs of prose. By hidden, I mean that you should operate as in the
above exercise, but after several rough drafts, eliminate the titles.
Choosing these ten words is obviously going to be somewhat subjective,
unless you have a program that allows you to do some of the work for you
(for instance, you could pick a word that seems to occur commonly, then do a
MS Word global search—the find icon under edit). This exercise may help you
uncover the trends and unexpected subject matter of your fiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Backwards. Write a story backwards. Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s Chronicle of a
Death Foretold works this way, more or less. Murder mysteries are told
backwards, in a sense. Most stories we tell orally we tell from the middle
forward until someone tells us we’ve left out important details, then we
double back. You might try taking one of your own short pieces—or someone
else’s—and simply reversing the sentences. What then? Unless you’re very
lucky, you’ll have to do a good deal to make this reversed piece of prose
make sense. Make sure this does not become simply a device. The structure
should be inherently useful to the material, which is good advice for any
fiction. 500 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Jointly Held Story. Speak the beginning of a story with someone else.
Choose someone you know well, who also writes, but that’s not a necessity.
Choose a good storyteller. Do this in a relatively private place, where you
won’t be interrupted. One person starts the story and continues for a few
sentences. The next person continues for another few sentences, and so on
for a while. You don’t need to start up right away after the other person
has finished his or her bit. End when you feel things getting exciting. Both
speakers should go away from the experience and write down what they
remember of the story, but don’t write the tale down right away. Let it sit
in your memories for a day or so. Don’t play games of one-upmanship with
your partner. Be faithful to the growing story and the characters created on
the spur of the moment. Listen to the other person’s quirks of storytelling.
Let someone else’s manner of creating a story guide you and influence your
own story-telling style. The two stories that result from this exercise
ought to be quite different from one another. 1,000 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Home. “Some women marry houses,” says the poet Anne Sexton, meaning
presumably that these women marry not men but the ideal of house and home. The
different etymologies of these two words are instructive. Home originally
referred to village or hometown. House has in its earlier meanings the notion of
hiding, of enclosing oneself. Now house indicates any house, and home is the
place that is central to our notions of ourselves. Use a home in a story
fragment (500 words). Think about the power of rooms (kitchens, basements,
unfinished attics, walk-in closets) on psychology and conversation. In this
fragment, make the house a unique participant (though a passive one) in the
unfolding events. The room need not be in a typical house. Think about all the
other rooms we become familiar with—classrooms, office cubicles, public toilets.
What are their personalities? How do the more public spaces we inhabit affect
our behaviors? You might consider keeping several characters permanently stuck
in different rooms in a house, communicating by shouts, cell phones, intercoms,
Dixie cups, or telepathy.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Belly of the Beast. Describe an unusual interior space, one with
lots of interesting appurtenances and gadgets sticking out: a submarine, a small
plane, a subway tunnel away from the platform, a boiler room in the sub-basement
of a high rise building. Again, do not yield to the easy use of this scene. The
boiler room, for instance, we all expect to hide a creepy axe murderer-type. Put
two innocent children in it instead, romping and playing among the glow and roar
of the fire and steam vents as if this were a sunny playground (their father is
the superintendent of the building, and he prefers to keep the kids where he can
see them). 500 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Absent.  Construct a character who is not present.  You have many options here: people may talk about this character before meeting him, or after meeting her; you might choose to examine what this character owns, how he or she lives, under what conditions; you might use indirect approaches, like letters or documents that attest to the existence but not presence of the person.  How do we know of people?  Examine the ways we build characters in our minds and in our social environments before and after we meet them.</p></li>
<li><p>Ways of Seeing.  Imagine a person with an idiosyncratic way of seeing the world (for instance, an occasional drug dealer, who, because of his amateur status, is more than usually prone to seeing danger where there is none; an entomologist who tends to categorize the world dryly, as if seen through a microscope; a world-class athlete whose clarity of vision is almost hallucinogenic).  Have this character witness a traumatic event that does not directly involve him or her.  Narrate the event from a first-person point of view, making sure that the perspective is carefully built around the idiosyncrasies of this personality.  Also, as a hidden aspect of this character, imagine him or her as some kind of unusual animal.  600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Loveless.  Create a character around this sentence: Nobody has ever loved me as much I have loved them.  Do not use this sentence in the fragment of fiction you write.  The sentence comes from Guy Davenport’s aunt, Mary Elizabeth Davenport Morrow, via his essay “On Reading” in The Hunter Gracchus.  Resist the temptation this exercise offers for a completely self-indulgent character.  Of course, some self-indulgence will be fun with this character.  But don’t write from inside your own wounded sense of the world.  500 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Loving.  Write about a person you love.  This apparently simple instruction may be more difficult than you think.  What makes us love people?  How do we avoid being sentimental when describing the attributes that make someone loveable?  You will immediately be faced with the decision of writing about someone you love or loved romantically or as a friend.  Or perhaps you’ll choose a family member.  Your greatest challenge will be to make your reader love this person, too.  600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvisation.  Put two characters in a situation that demands improvisation, on both parts, which also demands that the two characters interact and compromise with each other in the improvisation.  We should be able to observe the surprise, pleasure, and frustration that result from this improvisation.  Remember that most of life involves one form of improvisation or another.  Beginning writers tend to control their characters too much, so in this exercise you should work hard to let the characters surprise themselves as well as you.  500 words.</p></li>
<li><p>True Feeling.  Using language that is simple and straightforward, describe intensely and exhaustively a moment of true feeling between two characters.  Meryl Streep says that when she’s researching a character she’s going to portray, she always gives the character some simple secret that no one on the set, none of the other actors, and none of the other characters knows about.  Give the character you’re showing us this moment of true feeling through a secret, but don’t reveal the secret either to us or to the other character.</p></li>
<li><p>Teacher.  In a 500-word scene, have one character teach another character something that changes the teacher.  But this exercise asks you to go another step beyond the first layer of reality.  It should teach you how to play with more than one level in your fiction.  The teacher learning something from her student is surprising, though not so unusual as you may think.  The audience is moved by Rose’s tragic learning curve in the movie Titanic.  Imagine how much more interesting the film might have been had Jack learned something from what he taught Rose, rather than simply dying handsomely.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bunny Planet.  Rosemary Wells has written a trilogy of children’s books collectively called Voyage to the Bunny Planet.  The basic problem she sets for each book is that a child (in the form of a young bunny) has a bad day (in prose).  Halfway through each little book, an unseen narrator intervenes and says that the child in question “needs a visit to the Bunny Planet.”  Everything alters in this other world, first of all by changing to rhyming poetry.  The world is better after we hear the words, “Far beyond the moon and stars/Twenty light years south of Mars,/Spins the gentle Bunny Planet/And the Bunny Queen is Janet.”  Wells encourages children, in these wonderful books, to rethink their world, to take an emotional timeout and find a better world than the one children frequently find themselves stuck in—chaos, messes, tantrums, sickness, loneliness.  What I want you to do in this exercise is only very tangentially linked to this trilogy.  Use this hinge device that Wells employs so deftly.  For the first part of your 500-word piece, tinge the world in darker hues, show us a narrative style that reflects frustration, sadness, alienation, whatever.  Then, with a phrase a little like this central phrase of Wells’s, change everything—especially the narrative method.  Wells goes from a very dense and quite beautiful prose (almost prose poetry, as the best children’s literature is) to this light rhyming style (although she does not stick to one method of rhyme—she uses couplets, quatrains, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The Argument.  Two people are arguing—a man and a woman.  They don’t have to be a couple.  Each is convinced he or she is right.  You, as the writer, do not know—and do not want to know—who is right, but you will have exquisite sympathy for both points of view, both sides of the argument.  How do men and women argue differently? Couples tend to disagree over relatively minor issues, which often stand for larger issues.  Give us enough background and history, but try to stay in the moment as much as possible.  Narrative PoV is going to matter here a great deal: writing from one or the other’s PoV is likely to make it very difficult to show both sides fairly.  An omniscient narration may seem to be the answer, but I don’t like omniscient narration—I don’t think it’s really possible in fiction about contemporary life.  Choose an accidental arbitrator—a third party narrator, either first or third person narration.  This narrator knows and likes both these people well, but doesn’t and can’t favor one over the other.  600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Standup.  The usual method of the standup comedian monologue is apparently casual connections.  For instance, Elvira Kurt once started a monologue with the simple idea of bad hair.  “As a five-year old, you never had bad hair days.  You woke up with hair straight up, and you said, ‘I look great!  I slept in my swimsuit and I feel wonderful!’  Mother made clothes for me—horrible outfits.  She probably laughed herself to death.  I got back at her.  When I told her I was gay I said it was because of those clothes.”  Note the deliberate movement from plain detail to plain detail, with great leaps between the details—the mother making clothes to the coming-out declaration.  We are not expecting this transition (nor for that matter the simpler transition from bad hair to mother making clothes).  But the transitions are funny, and they affect us, shock us even in this day and age.  Write a 600-word standup comedy monologue, fitting it into a story situation you’ve already begun working on.  Don’t make it obvious to your reader that you are doing a stand-up routine—just tell a story as if you were doing a monologue in front of a smoky, irritable audience, with a Late Show talent scout scribbling notes at the bar in the back.</p></li>
<li><p>The Joke.  End a 600-word fragment of a story with a joke you like or loathe.  Use the joke as a way of coloring the whole passage, but don’t just lead up to the joke.  The joke should be relatively short, and it might be better if the joke is somewhat odd.  A guy walks into a bar.  He says to the bartender, “I’ll have one g-g-gin and t-tonic, p-p-please.”  The bartender says, “One g-gin and t-tonic c-c-coming up.”  The customer glares suspiciously at the bartender, who smiles innocently.  Another patron walks into the bar and says, “Scotch on the rocks, barkeep.”  The  bartender says, “One Scotch rocks, coming right up.”  A moment later he brings the gin and tonic to the first customer, who says, “You were m-m-mimick-k-king m-m-me.”  The bartender, with a truly pained look on his face, says, “N-n-no.  I was m-m-mimicking that other g-guy.”</p></li>
<li><p>Outrunning the Critic.  Write 100 short sentences about a character you are working on in a piece of fiction. The sentences should not connect and should not follow one another in any logical way.  The idea of this exercise is to force you to outrun your own thoughts and intelligence and critical mind.  Be careful not to be monotonous, using the name of your character or a pronoun to start each sentence.  A better exercise would be to write 200 or 500 sentences about this character, but 100 sentences is still enough of a stretch to make this useful.  The idea for this exercise comes from a collaboration the poet John Yau did with a painter, which was to match 1,000 small watercolors with sentences by Yau.  John Yau is the author of Edificio Sayonara, Forbidden Entries, and Hawaiian Cowboys, among other books.</p></li>
<li><p>Rehearsal.  Imitate the method of actors rehearsing a scene, repeating lines and whole sections of a speech, going over mistakes, etc., with several familiar characters of yours. Use this social trial and error to find new, submerged material for your story. You should think of this exercise as artificial and behind-the- scenes work, but it may also trigger strangely realistic conversation.  Human beings constantly rehearse and re-rehearse their lines.  The anarchic rhythm of conversation is more akin to a social science experiment than to the polish of theatrical dialogue.</p></li>
<li><p>Surprise.  Write a short scene about a character you’ve become familiar with over time—either your own fictional creation or a character based on someone you know.  Start the scene by letting the character do what you expect this character to do.  But at some point in the sequence of events, allow the character to do something completely out of character.  Let the character surprise you.  This exercise demands that you consider what is expected and unexpected in a character.  You may want to make a list, behind the writing of this scene, of the kinds of things this character usually does; and another list of the sorts of things this character would never do.</p></li>
<li><p>The Coma.  Write from the point of view of a person in a coma.  This is a permanent condition; the patient will not come out of the coma but still understands the outer world.  The catch: voices of loved ones are familiar, even intimately familiar, but the comatose person cannot attach names to the voices.  The coma patient has lost this capacity.  500 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Money.  In one short scene show us a character who has relatively little money—say $503 in his or her checking account and a $3,006 credit card debt.  In the next scene, show us this same character suddenly very wealthy.  Don’t worry too much about how the character got this money—inheritance, a lottery winning, an unexpected windfall.  What is the difference between these two states of being?  How has the character changed?  700 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Falling out of the sky.  Write a very brief story about someone who has jumped from the burning top of one of the two towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.  It took the buildings each ten seconds to collapse, but I imagine it took less time for a person to fall to their deaths from these buildings.  Watch Ric Burns documentary about the building and destruction of these buildings to see a handful of video images of such falling men and women.  Write about what the mind is experiencing while falling, although flashbacks are certainly possible (but try to avoid something like the Ambrose Bierce story “Incident at Owl Creek Bridge” in which a man is hanged during the Civil War and the rope breaks and he dives into a river below him and swims to safety and runs away from the soldiers and finally reaches a long, beautiful tree-lined drive to an elegant home and sees his wife at the end of the drive only to have the rope yank him back to reality and death by noose and hanging).  Once you’ve written one of these stories, write another one and then a third one.  Each story should be less than 200 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Dying Young.  In Cutty, One Rock, August Kleinzahler tells the story of his older brother, Harris, whose life played out like a romantic poet’s—except that Harris was a financial analyst by day and a hustler by night.  Harris, whose preferred beverage was Cutty Sark Scotch with a single ice cube, committed suicide at 27.
“It’s not as if he didn’t understand that much of his behavior was driven by desperation and self-hate,” Kleinzahler wrote.  “He wasn’t shallow or unreflective, quite the contrary. It was simply the way he was.  He was born wild, born troubled.  He wasn’t designed for the long haul; not everyone is.”
Write a fragment of a story about a character who is relatively young (under 40), who will die in a few years, but has no inkling of this.  You, as author, do, though, and let that knowledge affect this brief 500-word story however it will affect the story.</p></li>
<li><p>Concordance.  I’m not sure why, but Amazon has a feature for books called a Concordance.  A concordance is the alphabetical index of the principal words in a book (or the works of an author).  I noticed this on the page for my own book, I Know Many Songs, But I Cannot Sing.  The concordance lists the 100 most common words in my book:
across again against American another Arabic arm asks away balcony building Cairo call chair Charles city come daughter day does door down Egypt Egyptian English European even eyes face feels few first friend Gamal girl go going good hand head himself home hour Ib ih know language last laughs Ib Lena lights long look man men  moment name next night now old own people prisoner read right room Ruqayyah Safeyya say saying see sits small something speak stands still story street table take talk tell thing think three time told turns two walks want wife without woman word years Yehya
I’m not sure what “ih” is, but this is an interesting distillation of a book.  Here is the concordance for James Joyce’s Ulysses:
again always arms asked away behind bit black Bloom call came come course day Dedalus door down ever eyes face father fellow first get girl give go god going good got  hand  hat head heart high himself house Joe John know last left let life little long look lord love man men might mother Mr Mulligan must name new night now old own place poor put right round saw say see sir something Stephen still street take tell thing think though thought three time told took two voice want water went white wife without woman words world years yes young
Pick a book you like and know well that has one of these concordances on the Amazon site.  Write a 500-word exercise using only these words as your vocabulary.  Let the words guide you toward the subject of this fragment of fiction—see if you can find, independent of the novel you know, the sort of content and mood or tone this piece of narrative should have.</p></li>

<h1>Gretchen Rubin</h1>

<p>This is from Gretchen Rubin’s website (http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/).</p>

<ol>
<li>Happy.  Here are Gretchen Rubin’s twelve commandments for her Happiness Project:
	<ol><li>Be Gretchen.</li>
	<li>Let it go.</li>
	<li>Act as I would feel.</li>
	<li>Do it now.</li>
	<li>Be polite and be fair.</li>
	<li>Enjoy the process.</li>
	<li>Spend out.</li>
	<li>Identify the problem.</li>
	<li>Lighten up.</li>
	<li>Do what ought to be done.</li>
	<li>No calculation.</li>
	<li>There is only love. <br /></li>
	</ol>
<p>Write a very short story (no more than 700 words long) in which the main
character is happy, following some or all of these rules, but silently, without
pronouncing any of them aloud (and without using the name Gretchen, though it is
a lovely and archaic name).</p></li>

<li><p>Blind.  Write a short scene from a third-person attached point of view of a character who has just lost his or her sight.  Do not tell us how this person became blind.  400 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Lost.  Write about a town that has disappeared.  It could be a Palestinian village on a hillside in what is now Israel, forcibly evacuated in 1948 and then “erased” from maps and view (though there are vegetable remains of the town).  It could be a ghost town in the American west—a silver or gold rush boom town which remains in substantial form but is empty of people.  It could be an African town erased by the encroaching Sahara.  Or it could be a village sunk under a reservoir formed in 1933 in Massachusetts.  Write about it in the present and at the moment of its last human habitation and at its most vibrant, lively apex.  600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>A Beautiful Woman.  Describe a couple of encounters a beautiful woman has with several strangers within a short space of time—an hour or two.  Don’t tell us that this is a beautiful woman, the sort of beautiful woman who turns heads, who receives slightly better treatment than the average human being, who moves through the world constantly aware of people’s observation of her.  Don’t tell us any of this—just let her move through your story untroubled by her beauty.  It will be our little secret.  600 words.</p></li>
<li><p>The Apocalypse.  Heinrich Heine said, “Holland is always fifty years behind the times, so if I hear the world is about to end, I’ll go to Holland.”  Write a comedy about the end of the world.  666 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Own Swann. Doubtless the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days
differed hugely from the Swann created by my great-aunt when, of an evening, in
our little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate,
she would inject and vitalize with everything she knew about the Swann family
the obscure and shadowy figure who emerged, with my grandmother in his wake,
from the dark background and who was identified by his voice. But then, even in
the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to
constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone and need only be
turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social
personality is a creation of the thoughts of other people.</p></li>
