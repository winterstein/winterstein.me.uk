<scene>An Aggressive Recruitment Policy</scene><br>
[A large man enters, draws a gun and points it at EDDY's head]<br>
EDDY: Shit, are my library books overdue already?<br>
MUSCLES: No Smartshit, you're subscription to Amnesty ran out. They want to know why you don't care no more.<br>
EDDY: I no longer believe in innocent civilians.<br>
MUSCLES: That just breaks my heart Smartshit. But now that we got the pleasantries out the way, you're coming with me. <br>
The Boss has a job for you.<br>
EDDY: Not me. I've got too much on already.<br>
MUSCLES: Perhaps you don't know who I work for.<br>
EDDY: Muscles Mallone, you work homicide for Sweetface Harry.<br>
MUSCLES: That's right and he has a job for you.<br>
EDDY: Tell Harry sorry, but I've got too much on already.<br>
MUSCLES: Maybe you should tell him yourself. [cocks gun]<br>
EDDY: You're not going to use that.<br>
MUSCLES: You certain? It ain't wise to be too certain.<br>
[silence]<br>
MUSCLES: Well maybe. [lowers gun] But I also got this. [holds up a fist] Any second now, your dental records could be real out of date.<br>
EDDY: You've got a way with words. Anyone ever tell you that?<br>
MUSCLES: Just because I look stupid don't mean I am.<br>
EDDY: It's coincidental then.<br>
MUSCLES: I also look like a man who could beat you into a sticky pulp roughly the colour and consistency of raspberry jam without breaking sweat.<br>
EDDY: Careful; I stain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>Now Make With The Investigating</scene><br>
HARRY: Eddy Blake, and not a scratch or broken jaw on you. Muscles you're getting good at this subtlety thing.<br>
MUSCLES: Thanks Boss. <br>
HARRY: I got a job for you Eddy.<br>
EDDY: Don't know that I'm available.<br>
HARRY: A bit of gratitude might do wonders for your life expectancy. You may not know this but it's only my word that keeps you alive in this town.<br>
EDDY: How's that?<br>
HARRY: You know Red Scharlach?<br>
EDDY: Yeah.<br>
HARRY: So he wants to take out a contract on you. Something to do with putting in brother away.<br>
EDDY: How much am I worth?<br>
HARRY: Ten large.<br>
EDDY: I'm flattered. If he'll made it 15 I'll do the job myself.<br>
HARRY: So the reason you haven't given up breathing yet is that I vetoed any such action in my territory.<br>
EDDY: You almost restore my faith in humanity.<br>
HARRY: Fuck you, what do I care if you live or die? Except that you do it in my turf, and I ain't having Red Scharlach calling in hit jobs in my turf without going through the proper channels. But this puts you in my debt, &amp; so you best make with the co-operation.<br>
EDDY: Give me fifty bucks and tell me your problems.<br>
HARRY: I have a number shuffler by the name of Yiddish Mack.<br>
EDDY: Yiddish Mack.<br>
HARRY: Marcel Yarmolinsky to the proper authorities, being only the morgue now. Someone offed him last night.<br>
EDDY: How?<br>
HARRY: Ventilated with a knife.<br>
EDDY: Where'd it happen?<br>
HARRY: You know the Windsor Hotel?<br>
EDDY: Expensive pile of bricks over on east side. Any witnesses?<br>
HARRY: One. The night porter caught a glimpse of the perp as he fled.<br>
EDDY: So you've got a description. Can't your boys handle this?<br>
HARRY: Sure. They already shot the perp in 3 places.<br>
EDDY: Yeah? So why'd you send the extra large without manners round my place?<br>
HARRY: They shot the perp in 3 different alleys in 3 different parts of town. And he denied it each time. So I'm thinking, what with there being so many perps in this town, maybe my boys missed.<br>
EDDY: What's the police's angle on it?<br>
HARRY: What've they got to do with it? Yiddish Mack was one of my boys. I sent the police home. I imagine they'll put natural causes on the certificate when they present it to his next of kin.<br>
EDDY: Anyone with a grudge against him?<br>
HARRY: Who'd want to ice someone else's number shuffler?<br>
EDDY: They may lack your knack for making enemies, but not everyone loves them. Someone didn't love this one enough to oblong him.<br>
HARRY: Which is why I hired you. To investigate. So get your PI arse over to the Windsor and make with the investigating, because I have got other shit to be doing. Muscles will help you. <br>
EDDY: I only work with qualified people. <br>
HARRY: What's that PI?<br>
EDDY: This mobile beef mountain don't qualify as a person.<br>
HARRY: Muscles, if he cracks wise again, break his left arm. He can still investigate with one arm. Now get lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>The First Letter of The Name</scene><br>
EDDY: How'd you say he died?<br>
MUSCLES: By mistake. He had the room next to the hysterical broad<br>
EDDY: Mrs Morris from out of New York. tobacco money and lots of it.<br>
MUSCLES: Yeah. Rubies like grapefruits. That's what the attacker was after, but he screwed up and broke into the wrong room. He disturbs Yarmolinsky, and kills him to escape.<br>
EDDY: It may not be as straightforward as it looks. There was a loaded typewriter on the desk. The paper blank except for one sentence.<br>
MUSCLES: I didn't notice that. What'd it say?<br>
EDDY: 'The first letter of the name has been written.'<br>
MUSCLES: What does that mean?<br>
EDDY: I don't know yet.<br>
[JOURNO enters, takes a flash photo of the room]<br>
MUSCLES: Who the fuck are you? [somewhat aggresively]<br>
JOURNO: Hey let go, I'm just a newspaperman.<br>
MUSCLES: We didn't order no media coverage.<br>
EDDY: Just a second. Who do you work for?<br>
JOURNO: I'm a reporter for the Yiddische Zeitung.<br>
EDDY: So you'd know who's who in the Jewish community.<br>
JOURNO: I can tell a Goldberg from a Goldstein.<br>
EDDY: So tell me about Marcel Yarmolinsky.<br>
JOURNO: He trained as a rabbi originally. A bright spark at the Yeshiva, but no-one likes to talk about him now.<br>
EDDY: Why not?<br>
JOURNO: His research isn't considered to be kosher.<br>
EDDY: Research? What kind of research did he do?<br>
JOURNO: Cabala.<br>
EDDY: That's like black magic right?<br>
JOURNO: No, no it's occult certainly, and most rabbi's don't approve<br>
of it, but it's just another way of interpreting the scriptures, only<br>
looking for hidden meanings. The idea is that since the torah is the<br>
word of God, and God is omniscient, then any patterns in the torah were put there by him.<br>
EDDY: What sort of patterns?<br>
JOURNO: Ciphers, numerical codes, but that shit is over my head. And I don't want to know about it either. You understand even a part of it, it'll drive you insane.<br>
MUSCLES: A mystic number shuffler, huh?<br>
EDDY: This is one of his book's right? 'Tetragammatron: A Symmetrical Maze'<br>
JOURNO: Guess so.<br>
EDDY: Found on that desk. You know what it's about?<br>
JOURNO: The Tetragammatron is the secret name of god. You want to know more than that and you're talking to the wrong reporter. Until recently I was covering weddings.<br>
JOURNO: You're the investigating officer?<br>
EDDY: You could say that. Eddy Blake, PI.<br>
JOURNO: So who killed him?<br>
EDDY: We don't know yet.<br>
JOURNO: Do you have any leads?<br>
EDDY: I believe the key to this mystery may lie in his own writings.<br>
JOURNO: Yeah? That's interesting. What's the yeti's involvement?<br>
MUSCLES: Hey. I'm just a shy guy who don't want no publicity. [picks up JOURNO] Now you can print his cockamamie shit, but you don't want to print nothing about me or my employer.<br>
JOURNO: I didn't see you. I was never here. [exits]<br>
EDDY: Come on Yeti. I need a drink. [exit EDDY and MUSCLES]<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>Another Bad Case of Assasination</scene><br>
[MUSCLES enters]<br>
EDDY: Please tell me you're not a Kiss-a-gram.<br>
[HARRY enters]<br>
HARRY: There's been another killing. A Shylock by name of Ben the Rabbi caught the sharp end of a bullet.<br>
EDDY: Another one of yours?<br>
HARRY: Yeah. And guess what? Another note.<br>
MUSCLES: 'The second letter of the name has been uttered'<br>
HARRY: So tell me PI, why is someone knocking off my Jews? Is this some kind of war?<br>
EDDY: I think these are ritual murders, committed by a cult.<br>
HARRY: An anti-semitic cult?<br>
EDDY: Like Christianity? No, I think this was the work of a Jewish cult.<br>
HARRY: A Jewish cult.<br>
EDDY: Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems Yarmolinsky was into it some strange stuff. He was<br>
a cabalist on the side, and a big fish in those circles.<br>
 Cabalism<br>
is Jewish black magic. It involves searching for hidden meanings in<br>
sacred texts, You could think of them as spells, except they use a bit<br>
more literature and mathematics than your average witch.<br>
HARRY: No shit. He kept that one quiet.<br>
EDDY: He was trying to find the Tetragammaton - the name of god.<br>
HARRY: God is called god.<br>
EDDY: That's just our name for god. Jewish tradition ascribes 99 names to God. Cabbalists believe this is an imperfect number, and that it points to a missing name. This would be God's name for god, and carries immense power. They call it the secret name.<br>
HARRY: Fascinating as this shit is, it don't explain why two of my employees are suffering from a bad case of assassination. Do you know who killed them yet?<br>
EDDY: I don't know who, but I might know why. They weren't killed. They were sacrificed.<br>
HARRY: Sacrificed?<br>
EDDY: In the distant past, cabalists have performed human sacrifices as part of their rituals and experiments. And the tetragammaton is the ultimate prize. If an extreme cabalistic sect were sure enough of what they were doing - they would kill to get it.<br>
HARRY: Enough. All I need to know are names and addresses.<br>
MUSCLES: You believe any of that Jewish voodoo?<br>
EDDY: They believe it, and that's what matters. My job is the same regardless.<br>
MUSCLES: Yeah but do you?<br>
EDDY: I believe as little as possible. The path of wisdom is cautious, we reason, we gather evidence, explore and extrapolate, conjecture and question. Always keeping an open mind. Which is to say, remaining uncertain on a great many things. It is not wise to be too certain.<br>
MUSCLES: You think too much PI.<br>
EDDY: I think too much for a living.<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>You Just Can't Trust Some Criminal Lunatics</scene><br>
[MUSCLES and HARRY enter]<br>
MUSCLES: Guess what Smartshit?<br>
EDDY: If you boys are selling raffle tickets, I'm afraid the girl guides already cleaned me out.<br>
HARRY: No, there's been another killing. And again the victim was of Jewish persuasion.<br>
EDDY: And now it's too late to persuade him otherwise. Another note?<br>
HARRY: Sort of. This time they wrote it on the alley wall, using the victim's own blood.<br>
EDDY: The third letter of the name, right?<br>
HARRY: No. It said: 'The last letter of The Name has been uttered.'<br>
EDDY: The last?<br>
HARRY: But this one wasn't working for me.<br>
EDDY: Who was he?<br>
HARRY: Some Ginsberg character. No-one I ever heard of.<br>
EDDY: [perplexed] It's not right.<br>
HARRY: Maybe, but it seems this concludes it. Here's your money. Less 500 for my protection of course.<br>
EDDY: You're dropping the case? We can't quit this case. Three men are dead.<br>
HARRY: What of it? There are many left.<br>
EDDY: Two of your own men, and you'll let the murderers get away?<br>
HARRY: As long as it's a religious thing, who are we to interfere? You're talking about imposing western values on another culture. <br>
EDDY: Jews are western Harry.<br>
HARRY: Even so, I wouldn't want that shit on my conscience.<br>
EDDY: Your conscience Harry? Your conscience is hiding out in a warm whorehouse someplace without an extradition treaty.<br>
HARRY: Don't get too smart Eddy. Your protection money will only go so far. I'm a businessman, and this cabala shit ain't my business. [makes to depart] You coming Muscles?<br>
MUSCLES: I'm going to talk a little with Smartshit here if that's OK Boss.<br>
HARRY: Sure. [exit HARRY]<br>
EDDY: [produces a hip flask &amp; pours two shots] To liver failure. <br>
[they drink]<br>
EDDY: Something's not right Muscles. I think there's going to be another murder.<br>
MUSCLES: It's written here. This was the last.<br>
EDDY: Maybe it's written different somewhere else. You can't go trusting notes written by criminals, especially insane ones. Remember, the name of god has 4 letters in Jewish tradition. And the murders were committed on the 4th, the 8th and the 12th of the month. All multiples of 4. They're symmetrical in time.<br>
MUSCLES: So there's another one coming in four days.<br>
EDDY: Right. Symmetrical in time... Find me a map of the city. [MUSCLES looks around blankly] In the bookshelf [EDDY gestures, MUSCLES procures a map]. The first murder took place in the Windsor Hotel. [he marks the map] The second was here. [another mark] Where was the latest murder?<br>
MUSCLES: Corner of Lincoln and Janus.<br>
[EDDY plots the third point]<br>
MUSCLES: Well look at that.<br>
EDDY: Three corners of a perfect square. Which means...<br>
MUSCLES: The 4th murder will be here.<br>
EDDY: Symmetrical in time and space.<br>
MUSCLES: What are you going to do?<br>
EDDY: [produces a gun] Get there early and bust the party. [pockets the gun again]<br>
In the meantime... [pours another two shots]<br>
MUSCLES: To drunkeness and beyond. [they drink] You know for a guy who collaborates with cops, you ain't too bad.<br>
EDDY: For a brutal thug, neither are you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>A Labyrinth With Your Name On It</scene><br>
[EDDY enters furtively, gun out]<br>
SCHARLACH: [stepping out of the shadows behind EDDY, gun drawn, pokes the gun into EDDY's back] Drop it.<br>
[EDDY bends down, places his gun on the floor. SCHARLACH kicks it away]<br>
SCHARLACH: You're early PI [backs away two steps].<br>
EDDY: Red Scharlach. [turns round] Are you looking for the Secret Name?<br>
SCHARLACH: [mixing fatigued triumph, hatred and sadness] No, I am seeking something more ephemeral and perishable, I am seeking Edward Blake.<br>
Do you know how to catch a monkey, Mr Blake?<br>
EDDY: I've never felt the need to try.<br>
SCHARLACH: You find a tree with a hole the right size, and bait it with nuts. The monkey sticks his hand in - which fits through - and takes a handful. But then he's stuck and can't get his hand out again. If he dropped the nuts he could escape - but he doesn't; he's only trapped by his own nature, but it's as tight a snare as any steel trap. There is a lesson there.<br>
EDDY: Yeah, monkey's are dumb. <br>
SCHARLACH: My trap for you was built using your own nature. In a way, you built your own labyrinth. And now you are lost.<br>
EDDY: Horseshit. Who died and made you the Buddha?<br>
SCHARLACH: Who died? My brother died. Two years ago in a gambling house on the East side, you had him sent to jail. Remember? My men slipped me away in a coupe from the battle with a policeman's bullet in my stomach. <br>
9 days and 9 nights I lay in agony. Fever was demolishing me. I became obsessed with the phrase: 'All roads lead to Rome'. At night my delirium nurtured itself on that metaphor; I felt that the world was a labyrinth from which it was impossible to flee, for all roads, though they pretend to lead to the north or south actually lead to Rome, which was also the quadrilateral jail where my brother was dying and this garden of forking paths. <br>
On those nights I swore by all the gods of fever and of the mirrors to weave a labyrinth around the man who had imprisoned my brother. I have woven it and it is firm: the ingredients are a dead shylock, a compass, a chassidic sect, a word, a dagger and your own self.<br>
EDDY: You killed three innocent men to get to me.<br>
SCHARLACH: The first term in the sequence-<br>
EDDY: He had a name.<br>
SCHARLACH: Many of them do. But I had no hand in his death. It was given me by fate. I read in the papers that you were seeking the key to Yarmolinsky's death in his writings. <br>
EDDY: You read the Yiddische Zeitung?<br>
SCHARLACH: I like to keep an eye on your work Blake, I'm a big fan. I knew you'd conjecture a cabbalist ritual, so I set out to justify that conjecture. I created a trail to lead you here. A portent to the north, east, west would demand a 4th to the south.<br>
EDDY: South of the river. Outside of Sweetface Harry's protection.<br>
<br>
[here i have a choice of two endings. the first is true to the short story i ripped the plot from]<br>
SCHARLACH: I have a final riddle for you: Did I summon you here or did you summon me? [he raises his gun]<br>
[lights out with a bang]<br>
[Or, we have:]<br>
[MUSCLES steps in, edges up behind SCHARLACH, grabs his gun and holds him]<br>
SCHARLACH: But you were expecting a few old Jews. Why'd you bring him?<br>
EDDY: I remembered something just in time. Jews count the date from sunset; not sunrise. Your murders were a day off.<br>
SCHARLACH: There's still one riddle left. <br>
EDDY: What's that?<br>
SCHARLACH: Did you summon me here or did I summon you?<br>
EDDY: What difference does it make?<br>
<br>
<br>
<scene>Epilogue</scene><br>
[??MUSCLES narrates??]<br>
The end of this story can only be told in metaphors since it takes place in the kingdom of heaven. It could perhaps be said that Red Scharlach talked with God and found that He was so little interested in the affairs of L.A. as to mistake Scharlach for Blake. This however would imply a confusion in the divine mind. It is more correct to say that in Paradise, Scharlach learned that to the infathomable divinity, he and Blake - criminal and detective, victim and killer - formed a single man.<br>
