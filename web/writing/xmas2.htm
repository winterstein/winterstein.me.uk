[Radio snippets:
<ol>
<li> The World Health Organisation published a league table today ranking Britain's NHS as 18th
<li> The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recommended
that the NHS should no longer provide multiple sclerosis sufferers
with beta-interferon - the only known treatment as it is "not cost
effective"
<li> The Royal College of Nursing estimates there will be a shortfall
of over 50,000 nursing posts by 2004, calling into question the
government's ability to meet its NHS pledges
<li> There was consternation today when Prince Harry broke his thumb.
<li> Responding to reports on Lakeland NHS Trust, Carmarthenshire
Trust, the Oxford Heart Centre and to press reports on the Whittington
Hospital, London, Dr Ian Bogle, Chairman of the BMA says : "Today's
reports paint a picture of an NHS in trouble and under pressure. It
could leave the public seriously concerned about the ability of the
health service to deliver quality patient care."
<li> Infections acquired in hospitals lead to the deaths of up to 5,000
patients in England each year and cost the National Health Service
&pound;1billion, a new report warned today.
<li> Tony Blair defended the state of the NHS in a speech today at St
Thomas' Hospital, London. He said "The NHS is a fine institution; the
pride of Britain and the envy of the rest of the world".
<li> Industrial action could spread across the national health
service, the public service union Unison warned yesterday, unless
plans to privatise the jobs of hundreds of health workers in Dudley as
part of the government's private finance initiative are abandoned.
<li> Health Minister Alan Milburn agreed a historic 'concordat' with
Britain's private health industry. Milburn confirmed this by inviting
consortia to bid for 18 controversial new Private Finance Initiative
hospitals worth &pound;18 billion.  PFI is a financing mechanism which
allows private companies to build hospitals and rent them back to the
NHS at considerable profit. The advantage for the Treasury is that
infrastructure projects are kept off balance sheet.  Most health
industry insiders acknowledge that PFI is an expensive way of building
new hospitals which means less money is left to spend on patient care.

<li> Tony Blair admits leaving the NHS short of cash.  Mr Blair
last night appealed to nursing leaders not to play into the hands of
those who want to scrap the health service.

<li>Health managers are blamed for a catalogue of serious failings in
the quality of care at three NHS hospitals criticised in official
reports published today.

<h3>CHRISTMAS EVE</h3>
[blue flashing lights across the curtain, an ambulance siren dopplers &amp; fades into voiceover]<br>
ALEX: I'm one of those people who are never ill, and only ever see hospitals as a visitor. So it seemed particularly unfair - or perhaps only just - that it should be on christmas eve I was diagnosed as having meningitis and rushed into Charing Cross Hospital.<br>
I suppose I was lucky. The symptoms are nausea, headache, aches, aversion to light, possibly a rash and death. Of these, death is the tell-tale symptom, the others being all too easy to mistake for a hangover. Fortunately my flatmate once studied medicine.<br>
<br>
[curtain up:<br>
DIERDRE does paperwork whilst Chambers gasps his last breath unnoticed?<br>
JEFF snores. DIERDRE enters from left, sticks a thermometer into ComaBoy, then another into the dead guy, shakes JEFF awake and gives him a thermometer.<br>
DIERDRE: [to audience] Dierdre O'Feeny. This is my ward. Senior nurse on the 4th floor. Started as just a D grade nurse. I've been here 18 years. Worked my way up to E grade.<br>
[She returns to ComaBoy and removes the thermometer, noting the temperature on his chart. She then proceeds to the dead guy and checks first his temperature and then his pulse and breathing]<br>
DIERDRE: [snorts angrily] Margaret!<br>
[MARGARET enters]<br>
DIERDRE: We've got a dead one. Call Dr Klein and the morgue.<br>
MARGARET: [looks at the dead guy sadly] Yes. [dials] Dr? This is ward 4 North, I'm afraid one of the patients has died. [hangs up]<br>
<br>
[DR comes from left, picks up the dead patient's chart]<br>
DR: [to audience: Dr Klein, houseman from UCL. The doctor was a good man. A little brisk, but that was understandable.] When did he die?<br>
DIERDRE: Well, I found him like this a few minutes ago.<br>
DR: So...   time of death [looks at watch, makes note]...  cause of death...<br>
JEFFREY: [sleepily gesturing at DIERDRE] She killed him.<br>

DR: Nonsense, nurses don't have the proper training<br>
DIERDRE: Ignore him doctor he's a troublemaker.<br>
DR: [scribbles away]... John Chambers... right, bag him and ship him - I'll get started on the paperwork.<br>
[DIERDRE nods, DR exits left]<br>
DIERDRE: I've had about enough of you.<br>
[DIERDRE dials on phone, MARGARET is busy in the background.]<br>
DIERDRE: DIERDRE O'Feeny. There's a bed free on ward 4 north. Patient died.<br>
PHONE: Great! We're getting desperate down here. Got patients with drips just sitting round in chairs. We'll have to start stacking them if it gets any worse.<br>
DIERDRE: Oh I know, it's terrible isn't it? I'm rushed off my feet here.<br>
PHONE: I bet you won't find any of the trust managers in over the holiday.<br>
DIERDRE: Oh, I know.<br>
<br>
[lights down on 'the ward' (DIERDRE &amp; MARGARET remove Dead Guy) DR &amp; ALEX enter from right into spotlight]<br>
DR: Christmas eve in A&amp;E, no time to stop and talk. Meningitis - We'll need a sample of spinal fluid. Get me 10cc of chloramphenicol. Nurse, test for blood type. Where's an empty bed? 4 North. Right, let's get him into the lift. Come on Jane - let's not lose our christmas bonuses now.<br>
ALEX: What's happenning?<br>
DR: Nurse - give him 20cc of propothal to knock him out. Don't worry.<br>
ALEX: Why not? [unconcscious]<br>
DR: How long till our shift ends?...<br>You want to grab a drink in, say, three hours and 15 seconds?...<br>Yeah, now would be nice.<br>
[lights off]<br>
<br>
