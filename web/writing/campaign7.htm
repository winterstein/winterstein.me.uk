 <h2>Scene 7: The Office</h2>
[A burst of jazz, lights up on BENWAY's office, end of the next day. BENWAY and SARAH are seated, JOHN stands.]
JOHN: So what the fuck happened?
BENWAY: Didn't you get my message?
JOHN: To take the day off? Yeah I got it, but it didn't make any sense. Are you trying to keep me away from the client?
BENWAY: No, I just didn't need you today.
JOHN: What? But it's my idea and I've done all the preparation.
BENWAY: There's been a change of plan. [pause] I went with Sarah's idea. We're doing the third world thing.
JOHN: What? 
BENWAY: I changed my mind.
JOHN: You lost you're fucking mind. What the fuck?
BENWAY: We're going with Sarah's idea.
JOHN: But it's nuts!
BENWAY: Yeah, but it might just work.
JOHN: What about - You can't just cut me out like that.
BENWAY: You're still on the team.
JOHN: Yeah but this was my big break! I was - You fucker this is betrayal!
SARAH: You'd know all about that.
[in victory, SARAH is obnoxious]
JOHN: You little bitch. You - this - 
SARAH: It's a dog eat dog world.
BENWAY: Children, please, it's been a long fucking day.
JOHN: Why? For Christ's sake?
BENWAY: The challenge.
JOHN: You can't fucking do that. 
BENWAY: It's my decision. [JOHN makes to object] Whilst I sit on this side of the desk, I will make the decisions.
JOHN: And how the fuck did you get the client to buy it?
BENWAY: You forget kid. I'm a salesman.
JOHN: This is a fucking mistake. You have lost it Benway.
BENWAY: Maybe.
[JOHN exits angrily. pause. BENWAY leans back in his chair.]
BENWAY: You were good today. Especially given the short notice.
SARAH: Thank you. From what I saw, you weren't too bad yourself.
BENWAY: Of course there's no guarantee that the board will go with it.
SARAH: But when they do their sums I think they'll agree.
BENWAY: Yes. I was impressed with the thought you'd put in there. Keep outsourcing production, with a bill of rights for the illiterate workers and one showcase factory.
SARAH: We tweak the proven model, remain competitive.
BENWAY: Have our cake...
SARAH: And eat it.
BENWAY: You know, there was a story in the paper this morning about our client.
SARAH: Really?
BENWAY: Yeah - they did a short piece about their unfair labour practices. Not a big deal, but it rattled them.
SARAH: Oh. Well, our campaign should help.
BENWAY: Did you read it Sarah?
SARAH: No, I get The Guardian. [substitute an American newspaper]
BENWAY: This shit is important. You need to keep your eye on things. But I never said that it wasn't The Guardian.
SARAH: Was it the Guardian? I might have missed it.
BENWAY: Oh you're cute. You'll go far. Although right now, you should go get me a coffee. Black, no sugar. I'm sweet enough already.
