May the laws of random chance preserve us! That things should come to
this and I should live to see such dark days! I keep asking myself,
was there anything I could have done. I'll probably get blamed. A
disaster this big demands at least one scapegoat. Already the other
hosts in Westminster are scurrying to cover themselves and heap blame
on me, but as Prime Minister it was not my job to intervene.<br><br>

 The title is outdated; a historical leftover. As I was told when I
got the job, we have a tradition of keeping traditions. Apparently in
the old days, by which I mean the generation before mine and earlier,
the country was actually run by a dozen or so men. These men were
called ministers and made all the important decisions by
themselves. The prime minister was the most powerful and had the final
say in what was done and the most airtime. There were also several
hundred MPs in parliament who were mostly spectators like today, but
did have some power to change the minister's decisions. These people
were organised into two rival groups known as parties, although I
can't see why. They were all chosen every five years in a nationwide
popularity contest between the two parties.<br><br>

 As you can imagine, this system had lots of problems. The popularity
contests were, history tells us, unfair. Nor could they have been
otherwise. There is a theory in crowd psychology that, roughly
speaking: that many people cannot be right. Worse, ministers were
often corrupt. Many took bribes or just ran things to suit
themselves. Also they were always worried about their jobs. They had
to keep winning the popularity contest or they were kicked out, so
they didn't have the courage to make unpopular decisions. What's
popular isn't always what's best - for example no-one likes paying
tax, but it's vital to the country, and pot noodles continue to
sell. Still, the ministers were only guaranteed work for five years,
so they kept on making short term policies. We mustn't be too harsh on
them; unemployment was a terrible thing back then with very little
hope of anything better. <br><br>

 Those ministers who were honest were
under a terrible strain. They were directly responsible for the
running of the whole country and its future. Millions of lives were
entrusted to their care. No wonder some of them went mad. There used
to be a painting of one such at No. 10 Downing Street. She was a
woman, which was unusual then, and you could see the madness, a sucked
in hard madness, in her eyes. Thank god the job of prime minister has
changed. I doubt that I could have taken that level of pressure. Her
picture's gone now - it gave me the creeps.<br><br>

Between the corruption, short-sightedness and plain old human
incompetence, people became disillusioned with this system. However it
took a long time for our own parliament to replace it. The transition
began when they tried choosing MPs and ministers by random lot. Whilst
still a dangerous way to run things, this did improve government a
lot. The essential dilemma that flawed the old system and all forms of
government before it - which were even worse - was this: the qualities
required to gain power were precisely the qualities which were
undesirable from those in power. Only those with a real lust for power
could get it, and they were unlikely to wield it fairly. This problem
turned many revolutions, so noble in aim, into repressive
dictatorships, and it is inherent in any process that relies on human
judgement.<br><br> The new system eliminated this. There were plenty
of critics who predicted disasters of every kind, but there are always
of plenty of critics and they were proved wrong. Those chosen did not
invade France, or repeal all taxes. It was then that the department
which would eventually metamorphose into our Department of
Handicappers was started, to train the new MPs in the duties of
government. The benefits were immediate. Mobile phones were abolished,
corruption dropped off, and there was an end to political
squabbling. More importantly it produced a national rebirth. I can
only describe it as a great groundswell of spiritual well being. Not
something that's easy to document, but a look at the records does show
both crime figures and divorce rates fell. The explanation is simple;
the people of Britain had been given hope.<br><br>

 Gradually it was realised that the improvements in
policy making were due not to better and more honest MPs, but rather
to the dying out of belief-based political motives. Ideologies are
always simplifications. They can never fit what is, in reality, an
unbearably complex universe, and when they don't fit the problems pile
up and grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of ideology from politics was a
great leap forward. Human failings however meant that problems
remained. The potential for corruption was still there, as was
parliamentary bickering. It became clear that the only way to produce
a perfect system was to remove human beings, with our inevitable human
failings, from the decision making process. The natural world, which
produces such miracles as the human body and rainforests, is governed
by the laws of chance. Attempting to impose an artificial structure on
this can only lead to trouble. Hence the gradual phasing in of our
current system. It began with tentative schemes in local
councils. Most people knew little about local politics and cared
less. The public were quite willing to accept making decisions by
`tossing a coin'. These schemes were so successful that the idea soon
spread. Faith in luck and gambling has long been a part of our psyche,
which can be traced back to the replacement of National Insurance with
compulsory National Lottery tickets. Today's government, from the
fruit machines in your DHSS office to the great Wheel of Policy TM and
the Golden Dice in the House of Commons, has been completely freed
from the constraints of human failings. Only the boffins in the
Department of Handicappers still have to carry any individual
responsibility. Even that - refining and checking the equations used
by the House of IBMs to calculate odds - can't directly affect
policy. Our political system has won a string of international
awards. Politics is extremely popular these days. Not only are our
ratings sky high, beating even the classic soap operas, but more and
more people are becoming involved creatively, now that anyone can
submit a proposal for any level. We must not let recent events tarnish
that achievement; this current crisis must not be allowed to damage
such a good system.<br><br> 

The investigation into how a terrorist group
managed to compromise security so badly is still underway. They were
clearly highly organised, well equipped and ruthless. It seems they
also had at least one man on the inside, whom they shot when the job
was done. Several infiltrated the viewer's box where they used
disguises to remain after closing time. Fake hollow fire hydrants were
found the next morning. Forensic analysis has revealed ash from
cigarettes of middle eastern origin on their insides. They were after
the Golden Dice. The location of the Golden Dice is no secret; to
prevent tampering, they never leave the House of Commons. They are
kept in a rocket-proof safe under the prime minister's podium. Or
rather, they were kept there until two days ago. The safe is state of
the art - requiring my finger prints and a TV audience of over three
million to open. The fittings, however, were just
ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;screws. After killing the security staff, the
perpetrators simply stole the whole thing, and were airlifted
out. Their escape was by a fast military helicopter which came in on a
flightpath towards Heathrow, but then swept across London and out to
sea. By this time all sorts of alarm bells were ringing in police and
military headquarters, but it vanished from our radar screens before
it could be intercepted.

<br><br> Obviously this was highly embarrassing to
the producers and potentially a terrible blow to my career. The Golden
Dice are only used for the most important of decisions, and it is my
privilege as Prime Minister to be the one who rolls them. They are the
highest power in the country, able to decide the fate of millions -
everyone holds their breath when the dice are rolling. Still, the
engineers assured us that the safe was completely impervious. It
could, they said, be destroyed but never opened. It was a fatal
underestimation of the people we were dealing with.<br><br>

A policy was added to the wheel
calling for a new set of dice. It had good odds, but failed to come up
yesterday. Then, this morning at 9:27am, a letter addressed to `The
Decadent Imperialist Infidel Dog People of Britain' arrived at the
House of Commons. It contained a statement and a video. The statement
was from a group called `The Marxist-Muslim Army of Liberation' and
claimed responsibility for the theft. The M&amp;Ms army is an
extremely radical terrorist organisation responsible for atrocities
against just about everyone. Their leader, Mohammed Nazif the
self-styled `Mother of all Maoists', is wanted for murder in seven
countries and for copyright infringement by Hershey in the USA. They
are known to have links with both Syria and Israel. They detest both,
and will take aid from either to attack the other. The complicity of
the Syrian military is suspected in this operation. Relations with
Syria have been bad since an SAS task force accidentally shot a cousin
of the King's during the rescue of a British teacher, convicted of
murder, from the cruelty of Syrian justice.<br><br>

It was the video that meant
disaster. It opened with a simple shot of a plain wooden tabletop. On
it rested what were unmistakably the Golden Dice. I had held them just
three times in twenty years, and each time I was filled with a sense
of the power concentrated in them. Always, though, I had felt secure
with my trust in the accumulated probabilities. A masked man stepped
into the shot and picked up the dice in a black gloved hand. Seeing
this, a sense of dread welled up inside me unlike anything I have ever
known. He rolled, and the camera zooms in on the dice as they tumble
to a stop. The final frame showed that a double one had been
rolled. Two ebony dots stare out of the screen like the eyes of a
malevolent god. The Handicapper of the Day fell to his knees trembling
when he saw those two black dots and his deputy fainted on the
spot. It was left to me to announce the terrible news to the
nation. There was no avoiding it. Constitutional law decreed that the
decision was final, and neither the Chief Handicapper nor I could
revoke or alter it. Dark and precise, the roll of the dice meant
nuclear war. The missiles have now been launched, and there is nothing
we can do but cross our fingers and hope.<br> </body>
