<title>Essay on Cambridge Zoological Museum</title>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambridge University is justly famous for its
architecture, one of the triumphs of which must surely be the
way the city centre's only tower block, the ugly concrete
Cockroft building, is completely hidden from sight. It is the
ultimate application of stealth technology: stealth buildings.
Apart from its invisibility , the place has only one other
architectural feature to recommend it. This is the large whale
skeleton which hangs from a 2nd floor overhang. The whale marks
the entrance to the Museum of Zoology.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside is a strange mix of the amazing and the dull.
There're enough assorted uglies (including a metre long giant
spidercrab) to populate a hundred horror movies. Alongside these
are brilliantly coloured birds, stupidly big prehistoric frog
fossils, flies that dress up as bumble bees to get free honey,
and a cute, if somewhat dead, duck billed platypus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text accompanying these marvels of the natural world
tends to be something unreadably scientific about how the ankle
bones differ from species to species, so packing a natural
history book might be an idea, but mixed in are some gems. There
are several tales of female nastiness (usually involving doing
the dinner-then-sex date the other way round) and the following
description of the deep sea angler fish: "the male is active
when young, but when he finds a female he fixes to her
permanently and becomes a degenerate parasite... effectively
just a sack with balls." An uncannily accurate description of my
own behaviour at college bops.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the dead and the downright extinct, there are
a set of tanks with a random choice of living fish and an
axolotl, a peter pan like salamander that, except in rare cases,
never grows up. Anyone who's had to share a bar with a drinking
society will already know that this is possible, but the
university's axolotl (who I hereby name Annabelle in spite of 
complete ignorance on how to tell the gender of axolotls) is
easily more attractive than a drinking society. There's also an
exhibit labelled "Largest Living Salamander", but it's a lie.
It's dead. You'd have thought zoology professors would know that
nothing can survive for long in formaldehyde.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is non-existent, so feel free to have your
photo taken being&nbsp;&nbsp;patted on the head by the elephant-dwarfing
giant sloth (sadly extinct) or&nbsp;&nbsp;play chopsticks on the rhino's
ribcage (second opinion needed: Do you think the horn's out of
tune?). With its unrivalled collection of worms in jars, the
museum is probably not the place for that all-important first
date, but it will recharge even the most jaded's sense of wonder
at the natural world.<br><br>
