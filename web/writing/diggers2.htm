 <h2>Scene 2: The same</h2>
[UNDERDOG is talking on his mobile phone whilst PRES sits wrapped in blankets]
UNDERDOG: You don't know anything!...
Don't say that. It's not meaningless. We give it meaning...
Yes I'm still hopeful... 
Well you've got to be optimistic. Because without optimism, what else is there?...
Keep strong! I need you to get us out of here.
PRES: Put it away.
UNDERDOG: Excuse me! Schh! [to the phone] Where was I?
PRES: There's no-one there.
UNDERDOG: [to PRES] I'm on the phone. [to the phone] Sorry.
PRES: Talking to yourself about yourself. What do you hope to learn?
UNDERDOG: [switching off and pocketing phone] You do it too.
[pause]
PRES: [directed at UNDERDOG] It's a bad sign.
UNDERDOG: Talking to yourself isn't a bad sign. It's when you stop listening. [pause] And I refer to myself in third person singular. I feel that's a lot healthier than third person plural.
[pause. UNDERDOG sighs and returns to digging]
UNDERDOG: My spade! It went through!
[Excited pause. They both attack the dirt, breaking through into another tunnel.]
PRES: [disappointment] Another tunnel!
UNDERDOG: [angry despair] We've looped! You've led us in a loop!
PRES: Don't be simple. We've been going down. You can't go wrong with down.
UNDERDOG: Unless we've gone down and round and down again the other way.
PRES: No. That doesn't work.
UNDERDOG: Oh.
PRES: It must be other people.
UNDERDOG: Other people?
PRES: Well [pause] other diggers.
[Cautiously they peer in to look through the hole. Taking a fright, both men jump back and fall to the floor.]
PRES: Go on.
UNDERDOG: Why me?
PRES: Go on.
[pause. UNDERDOG goes through the hole (offstage)]
UNDERDOG: I can see some light up ahead. [pause] It's torchlight. There's - Someone's coming!
[pause. Footsteps approach (somewhat muted by the earth). A shout offstage. UNDERDOG is driven back onto stage, followed by an irate SUSAN. She is as unkempt as you would expect from someone who has been living down a hole for a long time.]
SUSAN: Barging in like you owned the place. Who do you think you are?
UNDERDOG: I am Underdog.
PRES: [coming up to join them] I said it. I said something was going to happen today.
UNDERDOG: You've said that every day.
PRES: You didn't believe me?
UNDERDOG: Yes I believed you. Everyday.
SUSAN: [to PRES] Who are you?
UNDERDOG: That's classified.
PRES: [hits UNDERDOG] I'm The President. 
SUSAN: You don't look like the President.
PRES: Sometimes I'm not sure if I was. It was a long time ago. So much has been lost, now that we have no connection to the surface. Perhaps the presidency is only a story I tell myself. Perhaps I was just some man who got stuck in a hole. But I am definitely The President now. Who are you?
SUSAN: [slightly sexy voice] Call me Susan.
PRES: What's your story?
SUSAN: Well, I want to be an actress.
PRES: An actress?
SUSAN: Yes. I'll show you. [SUSAN applies some make-up, but without a mirror she makes a poor job of it]
[the following is loosely extracted from Blanche Dubois's part in Tennessee Williams' 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. It should be played in the style of a melodramatic southern belle]
Who told you I wasn't straight? After the death... intimacies with strangers was all I seemed able to fill my empty heart with. I think it was panic, just panic, that drove me from one to another, hunting for some protection in the most unlikely places. So I came here. There was nowhere else I could go. I was played out. You know what played out is?
You are not the gentleman I was expecting. But a hot bath and a long cold drink always give me a brand new outlook on life. Whoever you are - I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
[pause]
SUSAN: What do you think?
PRES: You'll fit in here. [pause] So, shall we fuck?
SUSAN: What?
PRES: Well now that the introductions are out of the way... [removes his shoes and trousers]
SUSAN: Stop! What kind of a woman do you take me for?
PRES: Look around you. What choice do you think you have?
SUSAN: That's not the point. These things are done a certain way.
You can't just ask like that.
PRES: Of course. I'm sorry. [pause. PRES thinking. He makes to speak, thinks better of it, thinks some more]
SUSAN: [to UNDERDOG] If he's The President, who are you?
UNDERDOG: I am Underdog. I do the digging. 
SUSAN: What is the relationship between you two?
UNDERDOG: He is like a father to me.
SUSAN: Like a father?
UNDERDOG: Cruel. [eager] Do you remember the surface?
SUSAN: Vaguely. As if my life there happened to someone else. 
UNDERDOG: But you remember?
SUSAN: Yes. 
UNDERDOG: [sighs longingly] How did you end up down here?
SUSAN: By digging.
UNDERDOG: Me too. But how did you start?
SUSAN: I've been down here so long, I no longer remember.
[This answer disappoints UNDERDOG]
PRES: ahem. [hits UNDERDOG driving him away. to SUSAN] You are - look very pretty tonight.
SUSAN: Thank you.
PRES: I really liked your acting.
SUSAN: Oh you're just saying that...
PRES: Yes - that's right isn't it?
SUSAN: [frowns] Yes, but you mustn't admit it.
PRES: I'll make you first lady.
SUSAN: [sarcastically] I'm the only lady.
PRES: My dear you are certainly the only lady for me.
SUSAN: [nods in appreciation of the compliment]
PRES: Will that do?
SUSAN: [shrugs/nods]
[PRES takes SUSAN by the arm, turns and bumps into UNDERDOG who has crept up on them. PRES beats UNDERDOG away. UNDERDOG yelps.]
SUSAN: You shouldn't be so cruel to him.
PRES: Cruelty. [pause] It's just a game we play, a pattern we fell into. It doesn't mean anything. [pause] Not down here.
[PRES takes SUSAN by the arm again. They start to leave]
UNDERDOG: So it will go on.
PRES: [turning] Yes it will go on. [with vision] But soon we will have sons and daughters to take up the work. An army of diggers. This is a new beginning. Now everything is possible.
UNDERDOG: You're lying.
PRES: Yes. [pause] But we will have sons and daughters to dig for us. You can put down your spade now Underdog. You don't need to dig anymore.
UNDERDOG: What will I do?
PRES: As you like. You are a free man.
[exit PRES and SUSAN]
[UNDERDOG digging. Lights down.]
