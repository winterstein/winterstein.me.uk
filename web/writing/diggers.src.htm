SET
A dirt tunnel sloping downward to the right. Stage left, there is a pile of blankets and a cupboard. A couple of simple lanterns are attached to the wall.

*scene-list*
Note: There should be more pauses than have been explicitly written in.

<scene>A hole</scene>

[Sounds of strenuous work. Lights up. UNDERDOG is digging stage right.]
UNDERDOG: [exhausted] This can't go on much longer. [keeps digging] I've been down this hole so long, I no longer remember how I got here. [pause] Digging. [pause] Too deep. I'm stuck in a hole so deep my only hope now is China. [stops digging and steps back to admire his work] Not bad. Not a bad days work, eh? [sits down]
[The pile of blankets stirs and a head emerges]
PRES: Cur! Why have you stopped working? The work isn't done.
UNDERDOG: [with despair] It will never get done.
PRES: Not at this rate. [he gets up] Look - You've only made it a few metres beyond the cupboard.
UNDERDOG: You move the cupboard! 
PRES: Nonsense. You don't work hard enough.
UNDERDOG: You move the cupboard! Whenever I get anywhere you move it.
PRES: Have you ever seen me move the cupboard?
UNDERDOG: You do it when I sleep.
PRES: Get back to work.
UNDERDOG: [taking up his spade and turning to dig] [with hope] We must be almost there, because I can't go on much longer.
PRES: [agreeing] That's logical. [pause] [mainly to himself] Yes. We've worked hard. Laboured. Harder than anyone can expect. I feel... [to UNDERDOG] Leave it alone a minute!
[UNDERDOG keeps digging]
PRES: Listen to me!
[UNDERDOG stops digging]
PRES: I have a feeling. <!-- In my bones, in my being. --> I feel certain something is going to happen today. [pause] Something momentous.
[pause]
UNDERDOG: What?
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: What will happen?
PRES: The next stage.
UNDERDOG: There is a next stage?
PRES: There must be.
UNDERDOG: That's logical. [pause] When?
PRES: Soon. Unless it is later.
[pause]
PRES: Did I ever tell you about the French Ambassador's dinner?
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: [quite the raconteur, although still speaking in slow stilted rhythms] There was a dinner given by the French Ambassador; one of those occasions. With my position, I had to go to a lot of such things of course. What can I say of them? The wine would flow like water until all the women were beautiful. But the purpose was always politics.
Now there was a woman there who stood out from the crowd: The new British Consul's wife. She was a very glamorous lady. Nature and money had conspired to make her so. Wore a full length white dress cut away at the back - tres chic, and tres becoming too; it matched her figure perfectly. Rustled ever so gently when she walked, like the wind amongst palms. And she had a fur stole draped over her [beat] exquisite shoulders.
'Is that real mink?' someone asked her.
'Yes,' she replied, 'But it's heavily sedated.'
She spoke like a chandelier. There was cut crystal in that voice; old money, manners without warmth.
Anyway, we were taking after dinner drinks in the garden. A nice garden, with a pond. Let us take - for a moment - a frogs eye view of the world. People are moving around by your pond with the the tinkling sounds of polite conversation, but this doesn't bother you, even though they've strayed unusually close to the pond. We frogs are calm characters. You have another a fly, enjoy the evening air, then - Splash! Pond water and lily pads fly everywhere!
The British Consul's wife. No longer quite so glamourous. Pond weed draped over her exquisite shoulders. 
You should have seen her face. We all laughed like hell.
UNDERDOG: You laughed?
PRES: [pause] It was different then. We had an ideology.
UNDERDOG: What was that?
PRES: A way of understanding. I forget the details. A mix of love and hate.
UNDERDOG: Surface things.
PRES: You had to be there. [pause] [imperiously] Prepare lunch.
UNDERDOG: [going to the cupboard] I don't know why I obey you. [pause] Can you explain that?
PRES: I am The President.
UNDERDOG: Yes. So you are to blame for...
PRES: Go on. Say it.
UNDERDOG: For this hole we're in.
PRES: There were factors beyond my control.
UNDERDOG: You pushed the button!
PRES: If I hadn't, someone else would have.
UNDERDOG: That is a lame excuse and you know it.
PRES: [in an annoying baby voice with ugly undertones] That is a lame excuse ner ner ner. [pause] Get our lunch.
UNDERDOG: [as he carries out the order] I could refuse. I am a free man.
PRES: [sarcastically] You are free. You are free to do as I tell you. [brief laugh; continues mainly to himself] Freedom? What freedom do any of us have? We do as our natures dictate. Nature dictates I dictate. Even if I regret... but that too is my nature driving me.
UNDERDOG: [bitter] Voila Monsieur. Tinned cabbage. [presents PRES with a dish, and sits down with his share which he eats out of the can]
PRES: Don't be difficult. There are lots of exciting things you can do with cabbage.
UNDERDOG: No doubt, but none of them involve eating the stuff. [pause] We could grow some more mushrooms.
PRES: No we can't. 
UNDERDOG: I can't see any reason why not.
PRES: It's not the right season.
UNDERDOG: There are seasons still?
PRES: Of course there are seasons. Fool! You know nothing about agriculture.
UNDERDOG: I know we're eating cold tinned cabbage again.
PRES: I told you there's a reason.
UNDERDOG: There's a reason for everything. But I'm not sure that it's a good one. [pause] What did you eat? At the dinner with the French Ambassador, what did you eat then?
PRES: [spitefully] Cabbage.
[UNDERDOG (sulking) produces a mobile phone and toys with it (e.g. making ringtone noises)]
PRES: Don't know why you keep that thing.
UNDERDOG: It's valuable. 
[pause]
When we break through, well, they probably won't have the technology anymore.
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: The technology to make these will have been lost.
PRES: Probably.
UNDERDOG: So it's irreplaceable.
PRES: It's useless.
UNDERDOG: Irreplaceable. And that is the source of value.
PRES: [pause] Give it here.
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: It's mine.
PRES: I order you to give it here.
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: What! I am your President & I order you.
UNDERDOG: This is private property. I know my rights.
[pause]
PRES: Get digging.
[UNDERDOG takes up his spade. PRES gets a cup of water and a mirror from the cupboard. He starts shaving.]
UNDERDOG: Sir?
PRES: What is it?
UNDERDOG: How many razor blades do you have?
PRES: None of your business.
UNDERDOG: Do you think perhaps I could have a new one?
PRES: No.
UNDERDOG: Perhaps for my birthday?
PRES: No. Even though it is your birthday.


<scene>The same</scene>
[UNDERDOG is talking on his mobile phone whilst PRES sits wrapped in blankets]
UNDERDOG: You don't know anything!...
Don't say that. It's not meaningless. We give it meaning...
Yes I'm still hopeful... 
Well you've got to be optimistic. Because without optimism, what else is there?...
Keep strong! I need you to get us out of here.
PRES: Put it away.
UNDERDOG: Excuse me! Schh! [to the phone] Where was I?
PRES: There's no-one there.
UNDERDOG: [to PRES] I'm on the phone. [to the phone] Sorry.
PRES: Talking to yourself about yourself. What do you hope to learn?
UNDERDOG: [switching off and pocketing phone] You do it too.
[pause]
PRES: [directed at UNDERDOG] It's a bad sign.
UNDERDOG: Talking to yourself isn't a bad sign. It's when you stop listening. [pause] And I refer to myself in third person singular. I feel that's a lot healthier than third person plural.
[pause. UNDERDOG sighs and returns to digging]
UNDERDOG: My spade! It went through!
[Excited pause. They both attack the dirt, breaking through into another tunnel.]
PRES: [disappointment] Another tunnel!
UNDERDOG: [angry despair] We've looped! You've led us in a loop!
PRES: Don't be simple. We've been going down. You can't go wrong with down.
UNDERDOG: Unless we've gone down and round and down again the other way.
PRES: No. That doesn't work.
UNDERDOG: Oh.
PRES: It must be other people.
UNDERDOG: Other people?
PRES: Well [pause] other diggers.
[Cautiously they peer in to look through the hole. Taking a fright, both men jump back and fall to the floor.]
PRES: Go on.
UNDERDOG: Why me?
PRES: Go on.
[pause. UNDERDOG goes through the hole (offstage)]
UNDERDOG: I can see some light up ahead. [pause] It's torchlight. There's - Someone's coming!
[pause. Footsteps approach (somewhat muted by the earth). A shout offstage. UNDERDOG is driven back onto stage, followed by an irate SUSAN. She is as unkempt as you would expect from someone who has been living down a hole for a long time.]
SUSAN: Barging in like you owned the place. Who do you think you are?
UNDERDOG: I am Underdog.
PRES: [coming up to join them] I said it. I said something was going to happen today.
UNDERDOG: You've said that every day.
PRES: You didn't believe me?
UNDERDOG: Yes I believed you. Everyday.
SUSAN: [to PRES] Who are you?
UNDERDOG: That's classified.
PRES: [hits UNDERDOG] I'm The President. 
SUSAN: You don't look like the President.
PRES: Sometimes I'm not sure if I was. It was a long time ago. So much has been lost, now that we have no connection to the surface. Perhaps the presidency is only a story I tell myself. Perhaps I was just some man who got stuck in a hole. But I am definitely The President now. Who are you?
SUSAN: [slightly sexy voice] Call me Susan.
PRES: What's your story?
SUSAN: Well, I want to be an actress.
PRES: An actress?
SUSAN: Yes. I'll show you. [SUSAN applies some make-up, but without a mirror she makes a poor job of it]
[the following is loosely extracted from Blanche Dubois's part in Tennessee Williams' 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. It should be played in the style of a melodramatic southern belle]
Who told you I wasn't straight? After the death... intimacies with strangers was all I seemed able to fill my empty heart with. I think it was panic, just panic, that drove me from one to another, hunting for some protection in the most unlikely places. So I came here. There was nowhere else I could go. I was played out. You know what played out is?
You are not the gentleman I was expecting. But a hot bath and a long cold drink always give me a brand new outlook on life. Whoever you are - I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
[pause]
SUSAN: What do you think?
PRES: You'll fit in here. [pause] So, shall we fuck?
SUSAN: What?
PRES: Well now that the introductions are out of the way... [removes his shoes and trousers]
SUSAN: Stop! What kind of a woman do you take me for?
PRES: Look around you. What choice do you think you have?
SUSAN: That's not the point. These things are done a certain way.
You can't just ask like that.
PRES: Of course. I'm sorry. [pause. PRES thinking. He makes to speak, thinks better of it, thinks some more]
SUSAN: [to UNDERDOG] If he's The President, who are you?
UNDERDOG: I am Underdog. I do the digging. 
SUSAN: What is the relationship between you two?
UNDERDOG: He is like a father to me.
SUSAN: Like a father?
UNDERDOG: Cruel. [eager] Do you remember the surface?
SUSAN: Vaguely. As if my life there happened to someone else. 
UNDERDOG: But you remember?
SUSAN: Yes. 
UNDERDOG: [sighs longingly] How did you end up down here?
SUSAN: By digging.
UNDERDOG: Me too. But how did you start?
SUSAN: I've been down here so long, I no longer remember.
[This answer disappoints UNDERDOG]
PRES: ahem. [hits UNDERDOG driving him away. to SUSAN] You are - look very pretty tonight.
SUSAN: Thank you.
PRES: I really liked your acting.
SUSAN: Oh you're just saying that...
PRES: Yes - that's right isn't it?
SUSAN: [frowns] Yes, but you mustn't admit it.
PRES: I'll make you first lady.
SUSAN: [sarcastically] I'm the only lady.
PRES: My dear you are certainly the only lady for me.
SUSAN: [nods in appreciation of the compliment]
PRES: Will that do?
SUSAN: [shrugs/nods]
[PRES takes SUSAN by the arm, turns and bumps into UNDERDOG who has crept up on them. PRES beats UNDERDOG away. UNDERDOG yelps.]
SUSAN: You shouldn't be so cruel to him.
PRES: Cruelty. [pause] It's just a game we play, a pattern we fell into. It doesn't mean anything. [pause] Not down here.
[PRES takes SUSAN by the arm again. They start to leave]
UNDERDOG: So it will go on.
PRES: [turning] Yes it will go on. [with vision] But soon we will have sons and daughters to take up the work. An army of diggers. This is a new beginning. Now everything is possible.
UNDERDOG: You're lying.
PRES: Yes. [pause] But we will have sons and daughters to dig for us. You can put down your spade now Underdog. You don't need to dig anymore.
UNDERDOG: What will I do?
PRES: As you like. You are a free man.
[exit PRES and SUSAN]
[UNDERDOG digging. Lights down.]
