Was that my stop? Oh it was, it was. And I've missed it. Daddy will never trust me to go on the tube again. My first time and I get lost. All alone in London and lost! Oh why couldn't I pay more attention! All those people were in the way and I couldn't see the sign and the train moved on so quickly. I just know it was my stop! Now I'm lost. Alone on the tube. How will I find Daddy now? I'll be stuck in London. Let me see - two pounds... sixty left. That's not much to live on. I shouldn't have bought that ice-cream. £2.60 - how long can I live on £2.60? Oh I'll become one of those fallen women Reverend Archer talks about. Oh it's terrible. They Drink and - and I don't know what fallen women do but it makes the Reverend very angry. I could cry. I think I'm going to cry.
Wait - Green Park. This is my stop. I'm saved. Oh thank you God.

"Oh Gerald," she said, "No - we can't!"
He held her too him, kissing the smooth skin of her neck with passion.
"Oh Gerald." She said, "Oh Gerald, Oh..."
He slid his hand up one long luscious leg, ran his fingers over her tender thighs.
