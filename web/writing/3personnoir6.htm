 <h2>Scene 6: A Labyrinth With Your Name On It</h2>
[EDDY enters furtively, gun out]
SCHARLACH: [stepping out of the shadows behind EDDY, gun drawn, pokes the gun into EDDY's back] Drop it.
[EDDY bends down, places his gun on the floor. SCHARLACH kicks it away]
SCHARLACH: You're early PI [backs away two steps].
EDDY: Red Scharlach. [turns round] Are you looking for the Secret Name?
SCHARLACH: [mixing fatigued triumph, hatred and sadness] No, I am seeking something more ephemeral and perishable, I am seeking Edward Blake.
Do you know how to catch a monkey, Mr Blake?
EDDY: I've never felt the need to try.
SCHARLACH: You find a tree with a hole the right size, and bait it with nuts. The monkey sticks his hand in - which fits through - and takes a handful. But then he's stuck and can't get his hand out again. If he dropped the nuts he could escape - but he doesn't; he's only trapped by his own nature, but it's as tight a snare as any steel trap. There is a lesson there.
EDDY: Yeah, monkey's are dumb. 
SCHARLACH: My trap for you was built using your own nature. In a way, you built your own labyrinth. And now you are lost.
EDDY: Horseshit. Who died and made you the Buddha?
SCHARLACH: Who died? My brother died. Two years ago in a gambling house on the East side, you had him sent to jail. Remember? My men slipped me away in a coupe from the battle with a policeman's bullet in my stomach. 
9 days and 9 nights I lay in agony. Fever was demolishing me. I became obsessed with the phrase: 'All roads lead to Rome'. At night my delirium nurtured itself on that metaphor; I felt that the world was a labyrinth from which it was impossible to flee, for all roads, though they pretend to lead to the north or south actually lead to Rome, which was also the quadrilateral jail where my brother was dying and this garden of forking paths. 
On those nights I swore by all the gods of fever and of the mirrors to weave a labyrinth around the man who had imprisoned my brother. I have woven it and it is firm: the ingredients are a dead shylock, a compass, a chassidic sect, a word, a dagger and your own self.
EDDY: You killed three innocent men to get to me.
SCHARLACH: The first term in the sequence-
EDDY: He had a name.
SCHARLACH: Many of them do. But I had no hand in his death. It was given me by fate. I read in the papers that you were seeking the key to Yarmolinsky's death in his writings. 
EDDY: You read the Yiddische Zeitung?
SCHARLACH: I like to keep an eye on your work Blake, I'm a big fan. I knew you'd conjecture a cabbalist ritual, so I set out to justify that conjecture. I created a trail to lead you here. A portent to the north, east, west would demand a 4th to the south.
EDDY: South of the river. Outside of Sweetface Harry's protection.

[here i have a choice of two endings. the first is true to the short story i ripped the plot from]
SCHARLACH: I have a final riddle for you: Did I summon you here or did you summon me? [he raises his gun]
[lights out with a bang]
[Or, we have:]
[MUSCLES steps in, edges up behind SCHARLACH, grabs his gun and holds him]
SCHARLACH: But you were expecting a few old Jews. Why'd you bring him?
EDDY: I remembered something just in time. Jews count the date from sunset; not sunrise. Your murders were a day off.
SCHARLACH: There's still one riddle left. 
EDDY: What's that?
SCHARLACH: Did you summon me here or did I summon you?
EDDY: What difference does it make?
