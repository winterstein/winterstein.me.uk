 <h2>Scene 3: The Office</h2>
[Another shot of jazz, then lights up on a conference room, 1 week later. SARAH and JOHN are seated, BENWAY is standing. The group dynamics have shifted: SARAH and JOHN are both cultivating each other.]
BENWAY: What is this shit? You've given me shit. I'm meant to go to the client with this? This stuff wouldn't sell bread to a starving man. I need to see some better ideas.
SARAH: We're trying our best.
BENWAY: Trying? What the fuck is trying? The only thing you're trying is my patience. What fucking business do you think we're in? I don't give a shit for you trying your best. So far your best ain't good enough. It cuts no mustard, is up to no scratch, stands no test, fails all relevant EU standards and is neither seaworthy nor fit for human consumption. In short, it sucks. Go away. Do better than your best.
SARAH: It's not easy trying to make slippers cool.
BENWAY: You want off the project?
SARAH: No.
JOHN: Sarah's just saying it's a challenging project.
BENWAY: Look, any fool can sell a good product. You are not fools. You are the fucking talent. Your job - our job - is to stop those fools who are selling good products by selling our product instead.
SARAH: I did have an idea.
BENWAY: Go on.
SARAH: We don't sell them as slippers.
BENWAY: No? What do we sell them as? Lamp-shades?
SARAH: Instead of slippers, we call them `house shoes'.
BENWAY: House shoes. 
SARAH: Yes.
JOHN: I like it.
BENWAY: It's better. It might work.
SARAH: Well thank you. I'll try not to let that go to my head.
BENWAY: I meant, good work. Yes, we're going to win this contract team. We've got a long way to go, but I believe we can do it. Now this is where it counts. This is where we show what we're made of. Whether we're ad-men or ad-mice. The pressure is on team, and the clock is ticking. Can you do it?
SARAH: Yes.     JOHN: Yes Sir.
BENWAY: I know you can, but you've got to get going, you've got to prove what you're made of. [pause] OK. [sitting down] Let's brainstorm.
[sometime later... (dip lights. BENWAY is seated, JOHN and SARAH shift closer together. raise lights)]
SARAH: You're shooting down everything we say.
BENWAY: No-one said this would be easy.
JOHN: [tired but trying][to SARAH] What do we know about the company. Is there anything there that we can use?
SARAH: I can forward you their PR literature.
JOHN: Thanks.
BENWAY: [sensing he is being cut out and suddenly feeling threatened by SARAH, BENWAY reacts by asserting his dominant alpha-male status.] Hah. Don't bother. Their PR department are a bunch of amateurs who copy their copy off the side of cornflake packets. Economy value cornflakes at that.
JOHN: What, 'these slippers are fortified with vitamins and minerals'?
BENWAY: No - it's just standard issue crap. A boring story about their boring founder. Blah, blah, blah - manufactured to exacting standards using the latest in child labour, etc. etc.
SARAH: [to JOHN] Something I don't get there.
JOHN: What?
SARAH: Well, if the client is worried about how they're seen to treat their workers, why don't they just treat them better? Would it really cost that much?
JOHN: Well...
BENWAY: [cutting in] Let me explain the way things work. Mr Jameson is on the board, he makes those decisions. He's there because he's good at his job. His job is to make lots of money for the shareholders, the other directors and himself. Not just some money, but as much as possible. And not just because he's greedy - he has to, or the stock market would punish the company. He was promoted over the heads of other - perhaps even more able - men because they didn't deliver as much or as quickly or as reliably. Perhaps they put family first or too close a second, perhaps they weren't hard-headed enough. No matter; he made it, they didn't. He makes decisions. The problems are abstract, clean.  He considers graphs, commissions tables of numbers, applies unwritten equations. 
It's all very simple.  He understands ethics. Ethics is an equation: potential profits versus the risk of bad publicity. He goes home to his wife and children. He's not a bad father - if not around much - wants what is best for his children. Wants them to grow up in a decent world. Indeed the world he lives in is good and decent. There are parks and trees, no litter or homeless.
SARAH: So he's hard-headed. So are the unions.
JOHN: She's right.
BENWAY: But not everywhere has unions. Mr Ramirez runs a factory in a such a place.
JOHN: Ramirez is a first name, not a surname.
BENWAY: Who died and made you professor? So Mr ... 
JOHN: Santiago.
BENWAY: Mr Santiago runs a factory. He's a piece of human slime. Very few people are, but he is. Maria is a teenage girl. She works 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, plus (unpaid) overtime, sewing clothes for Mr Santiago. Mr Jameson has an order to sub-contract. He gives it to Mr Santiago, who is considerably cheaper than the closed British factory his company used to own. Then Mr Jameson takes an evening off to be with his family. He reads his daughter a bedtime story.
SARAH: And we're working for this Jameson creep?  
BENWAY: No no for fuck's sake no: Jameson doesn't exist. I made him up. I was just explaining shit to you. None of that was real. I don't fucking know what our client is like. Maybe they're fucking lovely. Maybe they give cute rabbits to all their employees and they're only worried because there was one guy at the factory they couldn't find a Christmas present for. I don't know, and I don't fucking care. Our job is just to sell the stuff. Not just for Mr mythical Jameson, but for the good of the whole economy and our own jobs.
SARAH: This can't be right.
BENWAY: Wake up girl. Which cloud cuckoo land are you living in?
SARAH: Surely someone would do something. People aren't cruel.
JOHN: Present company excepted.
BENWAY: Ah, people - the consumers, the the ones we sell too. Let's consider the consumers. 
Keith is an honest man. He earns his living. Everything he knows about economics, government and politics he gets from his daily paper. He thinks the world is pretty simple (his is), and has no time for intellectual nonsense. He might be very smart or quite dumb; it doesn't really matter. He'll still buy the product. 
Alex is an educated young man. He's a member of a couple of charities. He disapproves of the USA's ecological, social and foreign policy. He watches films with subtitles. He owns a car, TV, video, computer, stereo, sports equipment, laptop, mobile phone, goes on holiday (travels) once a year. And he also buys the product. 
Gary can't afford to pay all his taxes; you wouldn't believe the cost of living in London. This shit doesn't interest him; he has problems of his own. But the product - the product is cool.
SARAH: But that's our fault!
BENWAY: Our success you mean. Generating wealth that trickles down to all. [shrugs] Someone's going to get rich doing it. Why not us?
JOHN: [lighthearted] Benway, is there anything you won't do?
BENWAY: Yes. I won't lose the contract.
JOHN: [to SARAH] Benway sold his immortal soul long ago.
BENWAY: Hell yes, and at a good price.<!--, but my soul wasn't immortal. It only had a three year guarantee.-->
SARAH: What do you think about this John?
JOHN: Well I'm not ecstatic about it.
BENWAY: OK seriously OK suppose. Suppose we did a lousy job of protecting the client's image. Suppose some newspaper articles and a televised protest bring out all the dirt. Well that would alter the ethics equation - temporarily. Mr Jameson insists on better conditions in the factory, gets on the phone to the PR department who start saying all the right things. It is a caring company. Conditions improve in the factory. But then the contract is moved to China where they have slave labour and offer better protection from journalists. The factory closes; everyone who worked there gets sacked. None of this appears on the balance sheet, or on the price tag.
SARAH: Wouldn't there be more protests?
BENWAY: Let me tell you about the protesters. Amongst them are some real smart people with hearts of gold, and also a lot mung-bean-eating sandal-wearing cliches - that's not leather sandals but soya bean skin. 
JOHN: A mixed bunch.
BENWAY: Quite. Take Sebastian for example. Goes to public school. He hates it and he hates his father for sending him there. He's a real rebel, although one day he'll work in the City too. He goes to a demonstration, puts a brick through a shop window.
Joe is a radical. He lives in a squat, attends meetings, hands out leaflets, shouts at the police who he calls pigs. He is part of something and they don't give a fuck and they're going to change things; the revolution cannot be stopped. He is against the (fascist) police, against the (corrupt) laws, against the middle class who he always calls the bourgeois, against capitalism, against the pathetic fluffies, against the USA (also fascists), against banks, lawyers, accountants and everyone else who is part of the system. He is an idiot; it's exciting.
Then we have Mina. Mina cares. About everything. She's trying to put the glare of public scrutiny on injustice, but it's more of a 40 watt glow than a glare because she hasn't got the budget for the powerful spotlight of coordinated TV ads, glossy ads, billboards, sponsorship and product placement. She's got candle lit vigils - which don't cut quite the same wattage as our dazzling marketing strategies. So she relies on the media.
Rupert is the media, and in a word, he's a cunt. More specifically he is a greedy power hungry cunt.  That combined with cunning money, luck and no principles to encumber him have made him very successful. He has a media empire and politicians are afraid of him. His editors congenitally confuse his interests with the public interest. Jack is a reporter. He sees the brick and the broken shop window and writes about a riot. He adds a paragraph about the bleeding hearts - what do they call themselves now?
JOHN: I believe it's the anti-corporate-power, pro-democracy movement these days.
BENWAY: Right. Same bunch of hippies, just a different T-shirt. Who'd have thought they had more than one? Anyway: Our reporter adds something about the politics behind the protest, but his editor tells him to ditch it. With me so far?
SARAH: Your simplifying-
BENWAY: Like crazy. The unsimplified truth is beyond any man's understanding. 
SARAH: I'm not a man.
BENWAY: Sweet. 
SARAH: Is this still the short answer?
BENWAY: Yes. So now we have the politicians - but they can't take a moral stand. Partly because they haven't got that much power anymore, partly because they wouldn't anyhow.
SARAH: Why not?
BENWAY: Every environment defines a selection procedure. All you need is success and failure and too many people who want to play the game for all to succeed. The bigger the numbers the worse it is. Sometimes there is an official selection procedure, but this is only part of the real selection procedure.
JOHN: Most enlightening zen master, but meaning what?
BENWAY: Meaning sometimes the freedom of the vote is like Henry Ford's 'Have any colour you like as long as it's black'. These days they're all compromised if not actively corrupt. Making up an example, say Alex is an MP. He was elected by 20,522 of his constituents; that was the easy part. The real work was getting his way up the party ladder. If he hadn't cared about power, if he wasn't willing to compromise - he would never have got there.
He still double thinks of himself as an idealistic man, but he's ambitious and does what he's told. He is ostensibly representing constituents whose lives he knows very little about. And the higher up the ladder you go, the further you get from anything real. So it gets worse. Tony used to be an idealist; now he is a politician. He listens to sensible economic advice. He considers the next election. He tries to keep the papers and the market happy.
SARAH: What about the good things? 
BENWAY: Such as?
SARAH: Whenever there's a famine or disaster, we give aid.
BENWAY: Which is a fraction of the debt repayments most of these countries make to us.
SARAH: Kosovo - the Kosovo campaign was a purely moral action.
JOHN: That's right.
BENWAY: Hey, there are no absolutes. This shit I'm talking isn't the absolute truth. This is just the short answer, remember?
SARAH: But basically, in your black-tinted view of the world, democracy is dead? 
BENWAY: No, democracy is spreading. However true democracy - where people hold the power - that may turn out to be an ephemeral passing thing. Perhaps we have already passed the high tide point. How empowered do you feel when you cast your vote? Do you even bother these days?
[pause]
BENWAY: Mr Smith is an economist. He has been trained. He looks at statistics, applies formulae according to theory. Because he only partially understands his subject, his analysis is firm and dogmatic. It's a subconscious defensive thing. Meanwhile the big companies employ lobbying firms to make sure the government doesn't do anything stupid. They have as much money as governments these days, which means they have power. And their power is concentrated and they know how to use it.
JOHN: [to SARAH] I think the short answer is almost done.
BENWAY: Shit, I didn't mean to rant so much. You want the really short answer? The numbers are too big, and there isn't anything else to control that. There are more people than jobs. Hence the laws of supply and demand say that people are not valuable. There.
JOHN: [to SARAH] Benway is a true cynic.
BENWAY: No, a realist. What the fuck could you or I do anyway? It sucks, but that's the way it is. The numbers are too big. The human aspect gets dwarfed by the statistical pressures. And each piece slots together, each bit supports the others to build a vast interlocking system that's pretty damn stable.
[pause; having won the argument, BENWAY no longer knows why he started it in the first place]
BENWAY: But what the fuck do I know? History has no respect for our predictions. <!-- Perhaps generosity and community will some day turn out to be profitable enough to work. --> Fuck, in a day it could all change. Hell, an hour would be enough. Everything changes, you can make a fresh start with your final breath. [sigh] It's gone 8 o'clock. Class dismissed.
JOHN: Anyone for a drink?
BENWAY: No thanks.
JOHN: Not like you.
BENWAY: Don't want to miss my ballet class.
JOHN: Sarah?
SARAH: [flattered] Yes. Sure.
[exit SARAH and JOHN. BENWAY lights up a cigarette.]
