"Let's go somewhere indoors." He said, "I?m getting<br>
cold."<br>
"I've gotta finish this drink." I replied, "For the past<br>
half an hour I've had a strong urge just to throw the<br>
glass into the river and it's only the thought of the<br>
wine in it that's stopped me."<br>
That touched his sense of right and wrong, so we paused<br>
for a minute whilst I emptied the glass in front of me.<br>
It was a shot-an-a-mixer glass from the bar, half full<br>
of cheap red wine. Jacob's Creek, 1995; a good year, but<br>
a fucking shit vineyard. I gulped it down anyway, then<br>
hefted the glass out over the water. It was swallowed<br>
instantly by the darkness. I waited, constantly<br>
expecting a splash as it landed. The splash didn't come.<br>
And didn't come, for microseconds that were definitely<br>
too long. Finally there was a crash and tinkle as the<br>
glass impacted on one of the punts moored on the other<br>
side of the river. We pictured glass shards spitting<br>
across the unused punt, laughed and left.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was long past midnight then. I don't know<br>
what time it was beyond late, but I'd spent midnight<br>
fencing with juggling clubs. Cut and thrust, parry and<br>
lunge. Spirit flowing, back and forth along the path and<br>
on the grass, shouting swashbuckling things and aiming<br>
my blows. Until my friend hacked a heavy handed parry in<br>
too hard and too accurate, and snapped the club. Olly<br>
hadn't joined in, but slipped off quietly to brood. Good<br>
friend that I was, I hadn't noticed. I would have missed<br>
him completely if it hadn't been for the broken club. It<br>
wasn't mine, or the friend I'd been 'fighting' with, but<br>
another friend who hadn't approved from the beginning of<br>
his juggling clubs being put to such uses. So (my<br>
attempts at surreptitious super-glue repairs having<br>
failed) we had to apologise, look sufficiently guilty<br>
for the requisite amount of time, and promise to replace<br>
the broken club. The guilty look kept me in the room<br>
long enough to connect with Olly again.<br>
He walked in self-consciously down, like the world was<br>
on his shoulders, and had invited some other heavy<br>
celestial orbs round for the night. Olly is a little<br>
younger than me, but with about the same level of<br>
tarnish. He projects better, or at least further; in<br>
this case depression. When he said he was going to sit<br>
by the river, I thought it wise to join him. Just in<br>
case he felt like doing something more active and<br>
jumping in it. If he'd thought it through properly<br>
perhaps he would of. The river was infamously shallow<br>
near us. Wide and picturesque but shallow. A suicide<br>
attempt would only result in muddy jeans and a ruined<br>
T-shirt; a gloriously ironic finale. However, either the<br>
mood left him or he just wanted the extra air down<br>
there. Perspective is important, and a cold clear<br>
atmosphere can do wonders. It didn't though, not this<br>
time.<br>
There is a heaviness which comes sometimes, a feeling of<br>
weightlessness but far too much mass. He smiled<br>
ruefully. A lost misfit. If only such misfits could<br>
reject society's targets as well as society's methods.<br>
But no, we all end up jumping through the same hoops,<br>
just to show 'them' that we could have done it. So,<br>
leave the straight and narrow, dare to shout, and laugh<br>
and live, but make sure you still get a girlfriend, a<br>
good salary, a decent car. Success is always measured in<br>
standard issue terms. Personal terms are cut to fit.<br>
"I just want someone." he says, legs dangling over the<br>
river wall, and again later in my room, "Someone to want<br>
me."<br>
"Don't worry about it, it'll happen." I repeat, "And<br>
anyway, having a girl isn't the be-all and end-all of<br>
things, it just opens up a whole new set of insecurities<br>
to get fucked up about."<br>
He looks glum, I spout other trite but unhelpful truths.<br>
The blood red wine is tasting better, but Olly refuses<br>
to drink. He did have a five pint head-start to start<br>
with and it's clearly weighing him down. His face moves<br>
reluctantly like his belly is rolling ponderously after<br>
it. He knows this black mood is unhelpful, knows there's<br>
nothing to be done tonight. He can't be temporarily<br>
happy though; he's done that too long. I try to connect,<br>
but it's a hit and miss affair. Now and then I hit on<br>
something, and he leans out of his chair to agree,<br>
interrupting the downward flow of the music. Nothing I<br>
say really helps, though trying is important: "You know<br>
the people who love you," I tell him, "And you need two<br>
hands to count them. You know that."<br>
It doesn't alter his mood. There isn't really anything I<br>
can say to help, no magic wand I can wave to solve his<br>
problems, which go beyond a girl for the night.<br>
"Goodnight." he says. Tomorrow he'll be smiling and<br>
won't mention this, or will do so only to say how silly<br>
he was. The pain remains though, but it would be too<br>
embarrassing to own to it by day. There's nothing I can<br>
do for him though. Nothing.<br>
He walks out. I wait for a splash but it doesn't come.<br>
