<h3>CHRISTMAS DAY</h3>
[lights up on the ward with ALEX in bed. An IV drip stands by his bed feeding into his arm, and another thicker tube comes out of his side]<br>
[DIERDRE enters &amp; takes temperatures]<br>
DIERDRE: [to ALEX] Wake up, open your mouth. [ALEX wakes up, sees drip, is shocked]<br>
DIERDRE: Open your mouth.<br>
ALEX: What?<br>
DIERDRE: [curtly] Open your mouth. So I can take your temperature. Thank you. Roberts huh. [moves on to JEFF]<br>
JEFFREY: Morning my sweet little rattlesnake. Mon petit serpent a sonnettes.<br>
DIERDRE: Don't talk foreign to me. What was that you said?<BR>
JEFFREY: Nothing.<BR>
DIERDRE: You've wet the bed.<br>
JEFFREY: I prefer to think of it as marking my territory.<br>
[ALEX laughs; DIERDRE doesn't]<br>
DIERDRE: Well, you'll have to stay there. I haven't got the time to change your sheets now. [moves to the desk, starts on some paperwork]<br>
ALEX: Charming woman. Are they always that friendly?<br>
JEFFREY: DIERDRE is. If memory serves, I threw up the first time I met her. You could say it was a gut reaction. Don't worry though, sister Margaret will be on soon. Are you single?<br>
ALEX: Yes, why?<br>
JEFFREY: Because that means you'll like her. she's lovely: young (30s that is), caring, pretty. Quite a beauty. A `babe' I believe you young people say. She's been playing hard to get recently, but... By the way, I'm Jeffrey, Jeffrey Witherby. [to audience: An elderly gent]<br>
ALEX: Alex.<br>
JEFFREY: Pardon me for not offering my hand. We'll have to shake later.<br>
ALEX: It's a date.<br>
JEFFREY: And what brings you here Alexander?<br>
ALEX: Meningitis. Yourself?<br>
JEFFREY: This and that. I came in with dodgy digestion, but then they say I have something wrong with my heart.<br>
<br>
[DR enters]<br>
DR: Mr Roberts. How are you feeling?<br>
ALEX: Fine thanks, and you?<br>
DR: A little tired, but otherwise not bad, thank you. You came in with
streptoccocal meningitis. It can be very dangerous, but fortunately,
you came in quickly. We were able to treat it, and there's no
permanent damage. It can be contagious, but only through close
contact: kissing or coughing normally. Is there anyone you've had such
contact with recently?<br>
ALEX: No.<br>
DR: [with approval] Good. Now, we've got you on an antibiotic drip. That second drip's
a nutrient feed, and there's another one for draining - they should
come off tomorrow.<br>
ALEX: How long will I be here?<br>
DR: You'll be discharged in 3 days when I come back. [smiles and moves on to JEFF]<br>
ALEX: [quietly] bollocks.<br>
DR: Mr Witherby, how are you feeling?<br>
JEFFREY: Old and weak.<br>
DR: Your chart looks fine.<br>
JEFFREY: So I can go then?<br>
DR: Well, maybe not that fine, just yet. And I can't help noticing that bottle by your bed. You know you can't drink alcohol anymore.<br>
JEFFREY: Champagne for New Year's Eve. You can't deny me that.<br>
DR: Well, I guess it won't kill you. As a one off, that is.<br>
JEFFREY: I know: no drink, no tobacco, no coffee.<br>
DR: Have a good christmas. [exits]<br>
JEFFREY: Wonder what I'm living for sometimes. [but he smiles, and looks over at the bottle on the floor by his bed]<br>
<br>
[MARGARET enters. pause. music swells]<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] O she doth teach the torches to burn brightly! Santa Claus loves me after all. [sighs sleazily]<br>
MARGARET: [to audience] Margaret Riley. Never seems to have problems with the male patients.<br>
MARGARET: And how are we today Jeffrey?<br>
JEFFREY: Oh, much better for hearing your voice. Whisper sweet nothings in my ear dearest Margaret.<br>
MARGARET: Stick your arm out; I need to take your temperature and some blood. And what about your catheter?<br>
JEFFREY: You say the most romantic things.<br>
MARGARET: You've overflowed.<br>
JEFFREY: My cup runneth over.<br>
MARGARET: Guess I best get you some fresh sheets then.<br>
<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] No man, no matter how smitten, wants to watch such a thing. I lay back and imagined my spirit drifting down neon-lit corridors and through wards. My daydreams revealed the countless squalid images of a hospital going about it's business.<br>
<br>
CLERK: On the 3rd floor, a hungover temp misfiles medical records.<br>
PATIENT: On the 7th floor, a patient drops to the ground. He is dead by the time the nurse reach him.<br>
MANAGER: On the 8th floor, a board meeting is in progress. The budget doesn't look good. With all the will in the world,
we have to be realistic. Some services will need to be... restructured.<br>
DR: And on the 9th floor. [into phone] Right, I see. Meredith Bakers, 90 years old, fractured arm. Can you tell me her 
history?... <br>
Yes, of course you would need to send her file, what I want to know is if there's anything else wrong with 
her... <br>
Cancer; a carcinoid tumour in the small intestine. Well I'm afraid we can't take her... <br>
There's no point in us 
treating her arm when she has 
cancer... <br>
Don't tell me how to do my job. It's fine for you GPs, you can afford to be idealists. She's 90 years old 
and has cancer...<br>
I suggest you send her to a hospice...<br>
Yes, I know a carcinoid tumour is a slow cancer, but we don't 
have space for patients like that.<br>

<br>
JEFFREY: Thank you. Allow me to introduce my colleague here, Andrew - I'm sorry your last name's completely slipped my mind.<br>
MARGARET: Alexander Roberts, brought in yesterday with meningitis.<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] O speak again bright angel!<br>
ALEX: Alex. Please. And pleased to meet you.<br>
MARGARET: Margaret Riley<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] Oh my Love is like a red, red rose /
That's newly sprung in June;<br>
O my Love is like the melody /
That's softly played in tune <br>
ALEX: Is it hot in here or is it just you?<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] Doh!<br>
MARGARET: Is that the best you can do?<br>
ALEX: A reflex mistake. I'm sorry.<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] I wonder what kind of underwear she wears;
something sexy I'm sure.<br>
JEFFREY: A rival! I challenge you to a duel.<br>
ALEX: How?<br>
JEFFREY: of wits.<br>
DIERDRE: [overhearing from the desk] Ha! Unarmed combat.<br>
MARGARET: [to JEFFREY] Would I cheat on you?<br>
JEFFREY: But he's half my age. He still has his own teeth.<br>
ALEX: What age are you Jeffrey?<br>
DIERDRE: Huh. Numbers don't go that high.<br>
JEFFREY: 67 and 3/4. Though I look younger than a lot of 65 year olds. Especially the dead ones.<br>

<!--

I'm more attractive than I look.
Well I'm the only man to have successfully climbed the treacherous North face of Mt Everest with one arm tied behind my back.

-->
MARGARET: Now, how are you feeling Mr Roberts?<br>
ALEX: I'm fine.<br>
MARGARET: If anything's wrong, or you want a drink, call for me or DIERDRE. [smiles and begins to turn as if to move on]<br>
ALEX: You're American?<br>
MARGARET: [sarcastic but friendly] Yes, how can you tell?<br>
ALEX: You have a very American kind of beauty. How did you end up in England?<br>
MARGARET: England just kind of happened. New Swansea, that's my home
town in Montana, was just too small. I wanted to travel, came to
London for a year and never left.<br>
ALEX: And how did you choose nursing?<br>
MARGARET: Well, I love - working with people. People are fascinating,
always different.<br>
JEFFREY: I'm different. He's the same.<br>
MARGARET: I'm sorry if that sounds corny. I -<br>
ALEX: It doesn't sound corny to me. <br>
MARGARET: Thank you. What is it you do Mr Roberts?<br>
ALEX: Please, call me Alex. I'm working as a runner for a studio up in Soho, but that's just short term.<br>
MARGARET: And long term?<br>
ALEX: I don't know. As my father didn't know before me.<br>
MARGARET: And his before him.<br>
ALEX: Aih lass, We've been clueless in my family for generations. I
guess what I want to do... is - something creative I guess. I did
foundation in photography, and perhaps getting into that
professionally would be good. It's not easy, picking one job and saying 'right,
that's, me.<br>
MARGARET: Yes, so far it hasn't been easy. Excuse me, I must go see
the other patients.<br>
ALEX: Goodbye.<br>
MARGARET: You'll see me later.<br>

<br>
[MARGARET leaves. JEFFREY rolls over and looks at ALEX]<br>
JEFFREY: Well?<br>
ALEX: No, that's why I'm in hospital.<br>
JEFFREY: Well, what do you think of Margaret?<br>
ALEX: What do I think of her? She's gorgeous. You were right - such a girl - and in here. Classy too.<br>
JEFFREY: Refined sugar is the worst for you. Yes, and you realise that under those clothes, she's completely naked. 
Anyway, she's too hung up on me to notice you. Terrible - the lust in her eyes.<br>
ALEX: You dirty old bugger. There's not a Mrs Witherby then?<br>
JEFFREY: No. She died ten years ago.<br>
ALEX: I'm sorry.<br>
JEFFREY: Hm. We were teachers at the same school. Married at 25. 
It seems like another life now. She was such a sweet lovely woman, my Eleanor. The
ever present, never pleasant past. Strange how in memories, sensation 
is reversed.<br>
ALEX: What do you mean?<br>
JEFFREY: Remembered pain is not itself painful. Suffering becomes
amusing. And memories of happiness - of good times, laughter, and 
especially of love - these can be unbearably painful.<br>
ALEX: Do you have children?<br>
JEFFREY: No. We tried, but...<br>
ALEX: I'm sorry.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>

ALEX: Patient?<br>
JEFFREY: No.<br>
ALEX: Pillow?<br>
JEFFREY: No.<br>
ALEX: Pickled porcupine penises?<br>
JEFFREY: Hmmm no.<br>
ALEX: erm... Paperwork?<br>
JEFFREY: No. Although god knows there's enough of it around. I sometimes think that the 
paperwork is the hospital's real purpose and the doctors, nurses and ourselves are just 
here to give it some context. Keep guessing.<br>
DIERDRE: Keep the noise down!<br>
JEFFREY: It's coma boy here. I tell him to shut up, but he just ignores me.<br>
ALEX: I give up anyway.<br>
JEFFREY: Pain. I've got a better game. It's called `I Don't Spy'. You pick something 
that ought to be here but isn't, like doctors.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>
ALEX: Ah, christmas dinner, coming up.<br>
[DIERDRE brings round christmas lunch, which turns out to be less than impressive]<br>
ALEX: Cup-a-soup!<br>
DIERDRE: Not for you, you're still on the drip.<br>
JEFFREY: What is this? The ghost of christmas dinner?<br>
ALEX: Cup-a-soup! Fu... ell [starts to swear but swallows it] <br>
<!-- J:This is a joke - and an even worse one than you get in those crackers, which we also don't have.<br> -->
DIERDRE: Well, the cooking staff are all off on holiday. What do you want us to do? Cook for you as well? [puts JEFFREY's tray down roughly]<br>
JEFFREY: Well merry bloody christmas to you too.<br>
DIERDRE: Look, I didn't want to spend my christmas here. I'm working myself to death for this ward. God! What more do you want?<br>
JEFFREY: Compassion? You know, I have enough to be depressed about without this. 
We're patients - people at their lowest point. Except, sorry, we're not patients anymore, are we? We're customers.<br>
<!-- J:Well what about the customer is always right?
	B:A right nuisance.
-->
DIERDRE: Units is the term they use.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>
MARGARET: I can't do that! I'm only a B grade nurse.<br>
DIERDRE: Consider this a field promotion. You know how to do it, right?<br>
MARGARET: Yes, but<br>
DIERDRE: So? <br>
[MARGARET moves to ALEX's bedside]<br>
ALEX: Now wait a second, isn't there someone you can call?<br>
JEFFREY: They're fast learners. She may be ignorant now, but by the end of the day, she'll be fully incompetent.<br>
ALEX: There must be a doctor you can call<br>
MARGARET: No.<br>
ALEX: Are there no doctors around?<br>
MARGARET: Oh yes, of course - there are doctors on call, in A&amp;E and intensive care.<br>
ALEX: Well call one then!<br>
MARGARET: Christmas day - they'll be even busier than us. Holidays are
the worst times for A&amp;E. I can do this. Don't worry. I know what
I'm doing. Now you might feel a little sore. [yanks tube from ALEX's
side, applies a bandage and ministers to the wound]<br>
ALEX: [voice-over] By 'sore' she meant, of course, 'excruciating agony'. Pain like I'd never felt before coursed through my body. <br>
MARGARET: Are you OK?<br>
ALEX: [gasps &amp; gestures] No, I'm fine, It's OK. If I could just have a glass of morphine...<br>
[clock forward]<br>
ALEX: [voiceover] Pain and more pain. You know what it's like; you've
been sick too. It's not unique, happens to everyone, but whilst it's
your turn, the pain becomes your world. All your hopes and desires,
all your opinions and thoughts are stripped away. The pain pares you
down to nothing but raw nerve endings. Pares you down until you are
left little better than an animal cowering naked before your pain. And
then just when you think you can't take it anymore, it just goes
on.<br>
[clock forward]<br>
<br>
MARGARET: Any better?<br>
ALEX: Yes, thanks. [voiceover] and then it fades leaving you as before; no better, no deeper.<br>
MARGARET: I saved you some dinner if you want.<br>
ALEX: Oh, thank you. I'm ravenous.<br>
MARGARET: You haven't tasted it yet.<br>
ALEX: [MARGARET hands him a tray] Thanks. [MARGARET smiles, ALEX eats] How's your day been?<br>
MARGARET: Oh...[various expressions of fatigue cross her face] OK.<br>
ALEX: I don't believe you. Honestly?<br>
MARGARET: Fine; a little busy.<br>
ALEX: You look terrible.<br>
MARGARET: Gee thanks.<br>
ALEX: I mean in a gorgeous, stunning way.<br>
MARGARET: Well I do feel terrible. [with a wry smile]<br>
ALEX: What's wrong?<br>
MARGARET: Just a headache, and tired. You know that tiredness where it feels like you're walking through treacle?<br>
ALEX: Yeah. Look, why don't you catch some sleep?<br>
MARGARET: [disbelieving tone - what is this idiot on about?] How?<br>
ALEX: Bring me a chair, and I'll let you have this bed. No-one would know.<br>
MARGARET: Thanks, but it really wouldn't do for the duty nurse to fall asleep. Suppose something happenned.<br>
ALEX: I'd wake you up.<br>
MARGARET: No - Can't sleep anyway; I'm out of practice. [smiles wearily] Ah [looks at her beeper] Excuse me. [exits]<br>
JEFFREY: In romance - as in so much of life - timing is crucial. Getting her into bed doesn't count if you're not in it at the time.<br>
ALEX: You have to start somewhere. And anyway, my normal seduction techniques kind of depend on being able bodied and having some privacy.<br>
JEFFREY: Excuses, excuses, my boy. I don't give you more than 10 to 3.<br>
ALEX: What?<br>
JEFFREY: Odds boy odds. I'm a betting man and if you care to bet then the odds are 10 to 3. You don't reckon you can do it?<br>
ALEX: Ok. I'm game.<br>
JEFFREY: Shall I put you down for a fiver?<br>
ALEX: Money in the bank.<br>
JEFFREY: Margaret?<br>
MARGARET: [enters] What?<br>
JEFFREY: Alex here has just made a bet he can seduce you.<br>
MARGARET: Really?<br>
JEFFREY: I gave him odds of 10 to 3.<br>
MARGARET: 10 to 3 huh? Put me down for a tenner. [exits. ALEX laughs.]<br>
JEFFREY: What time is it?<br>
ALEX: [smug] 7:20<br>
JEFFREY: Huh. 2 hours still till lights out. It's christmas for god's sake I'm going to celebrate. I'm going to use a toilet [gets up precariously, falls on champagne bottle] Aah!<br>
[MARGARET comes running]<br>
ALEX: Are you alright?<br>
MARGARET: What happenned?<br>
JEFFREY: My champagne. My new year's champagne bottle.<br>
[lights down]<br>
<br>
<br>
