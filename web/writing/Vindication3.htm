(4)<br>
He opened the envelopes carelessly and tossed a pizza ad and a bank statement into the bin unread, but stopped at the third letter. The address was hand-written, but formal. He had a reasonable idea what it contained. Nancy thought she was the only person he'd shown his story to, but he had in fact entered it in a magazine writing competition. The winning entry would be published in a couple of editions time. There was also some prize money but he had forgotten how much. This would be the reply. <br>
He was in no hurry to open it. His feelings towards his work normally swung between embarrassment and surprise that it wasn't as bad as he remembered. Now that he held the letter however, he felt certain it was a rejection. 'Thank you for your story, but...', and there was always a but. The thought of losing did not bother him. He knew there were many better writers than him out there. It was the thought of being judged on his work that he disliked. That he had sat down, put pen to paper and let his thoughts flow, and now others would read this, find faults and pass judgement. That he had signed his name to a few sheets of scrappy sentences which would be passed around and criticised where he couldn't defend them. Worse, he couldn't deny them anymore. Nor were there any ulterior motives he could claim as excuses. Before writing, his head had swirled with a thousand stories. Glorious tales that would bring laughter and tears to the reader. Something that would reach out and, in simple clear words, touch other people with the beauty of the world. Now that he had produced a story it clearly did no such thing. He wished he had never written it. It was a lot easier being judged only by his potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
So he delayed opening the letter for as long as possible. Mark had dropped round earlier on with an advance copy of the supermarket film, and he elected to watch that first, then further delayed things by making popcorn and fixing himself a drink. Procrastination is never done, and he could be infinitely creative when it came to avoiding things. The video slipped into the machine with a quite mechanised whirr. Josh's drop into the house's dirty red sofa was not nearly as evocative of precision engineering. He unearthed the remote from beneath a discarded t-shirt, pushed a couple of buttons, and settled himself in to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
It was good. Mark had a natural talent for camera shots that let the idea work when it could very easily have failed. The shoppers milled around, looking like cattle, yet at the same time very human. The way two till girls smiled at each other, or the older lady on the far checkout who tried to talk to each customer. It could have been him making that friendly hopeful smile. Or the man who pettily enforced the '5 items or less in this queue'. That could also have been him. The man threatening to write to the manager was eventually placated by a staff worker who then turned away with a worn out look on her face. Josh considered writing his own letter of complaint: 'Dear Sir, I was disgusted by the way one of your staff dealt with a customer. He was clearly in the wrong and should have been told to get lost, yet she was polite and patient...' <br>
Almost suddenly he felt infinitely weary. He curled up on the sofa and allowed his eyelids to slide shut. The letter slipped into a crack in the sofa. By the time he would wake from his nap he would have temporarily forgotten the letter, and it would have worked its way down into the springs. There was dust down there over a decade old. The next day he would look for it, but fail to find it. He would give up, and not have the courage to phone the organisers and ask about the competition. He fell asleep on the sofa, the TV-light flickering across his face, equal parts wonderful and ridiculous.<br>
The program ended with the last customers leaving. There was a close up shot of the store manager, slumping forward, his shoulders sagging, then visibly summoning the energy to do the locking up that still had to be done. Finally the lights were switched down and the last staff left as the credits rolled.<br>
