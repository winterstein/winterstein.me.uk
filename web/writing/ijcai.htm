Over a thousand researchers gathered in Edinburgh this week to examine
the question of intelligence. They met for the International Joint <br>
<br>
Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), a prestigious biannual
event that brings together a mix of computer scientists, psychologists,
mathematicians, neuro-scientists and philosophers.<br>
<br>
The discussions were varied. Can we make a universal IQ test that
covers everything from people to programs to pot-plants? What can 
tool-using crows teach us about our own intelligence? Several robots
were presented, with varying capabilities. A company called 
MavHome talked about the houses of the future: "The home has certain
goals, such as minimizing the cost of maintenance and maximizing 
the comfort of its inhabitants. In order to meet these goals, the house
must be able to reason and adapt." In such a house, you wouldn't
need to switch equipment on or off - it would do that automatically.<br>
<br>
Computer intelligence is also being developed for more serious
applications, such as analysing blood tests for disease. A lot of
people are 
interested in applying computer intelligence to the study of genetics
and molecular biology - a rapidly growing field called bio-informatics.<br>
<br>
The study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began 60 years ago with the
invention of computers. This prompted computer-pioneer Alan Turing 
to ask the question "Could machines be as intelligent as humans?" So
far the answer is partly yes but mostly no. Computers are very good 
at problems such as playing chess. They have great difficulty though
with the things we take for granted: handling day-to-day life.<br>
<br>
Machines find everyday life challenging partly because of its
unpredictability, and partly because they lack the rich understanding
of the
world that we have by nature. Strangely, beating Kasparov at chess is
easier for a machine than holding a conversation about last night's 
telly.<br>
<br>
For a long time, AI seemed to be just a science fiction fantasy.
Periodically, there would be a burst of excitement over a new
technology. 
This would be followed by disappointment, as the new technology failed
to deliver.<br>
<br>
In many ways AI is still a pipe dream, yet the mood of the conference
was optimistic. Many problems that were previously thought 
unsolvable are now being cracked. Problems that would previously have
required years of computation can now be solved in under a 
second.
This progress is partly driven by the astonishing - and ongoing -
improvements in computing power. Alongside this, there have also been 
remarkable improvements in the algorithms (mathematical techniques)
used for computing problems.<br>
<br>
One highlight of the week was Zeynep Kiziltan's work on faster
algorithms for problem solving, which earned her an award for the best 
Ph.D. in the field. Zeynep, a bright young scientist from Turkey,
is excited about the state of AI. "We're making a lot of progress!" she
said, but added that the future would bring further improvements. "In
10 years time we will look back and think today's systems are very
primitive."<br>

The conference also honoured the work of British scientist Professor
Geoff Hinton, who received an award for Research Excellence. 
Hinton was a key figure in the development of neural networks -
computer programs that imitate collections of nerve cells.
Our brains - and those of all animals down to the humblest slugs and
snails - are made up of nerve cells. These are connected together so 
that when one is active, it can trigger others to become active or
switch them off. Over time, the connections between cells change,
allowing animals to learn. Remarkably, these networks of nerve cells
can produce the wonderfully complex and varied behaviour we see in 
the natural world and above all in ourselves.<br>
<br>
Faced with the failure of conventional computing to tackle everyday
problems, AI researchers looked to the brain for inspiration. They 
developed techniques based on networks of simulated neurons.<br>
<br>
In conventional computing, programs are carefully written by IT
experts. By contrast, a neural network is not programmed but trained.
It 
is shown lots of examples. Clever algorithms - devised by Hinton and
his colleagues - allow it to learn from these examples by altering the 
network's connections.
Neural network programs are good at spotting visual patterns, and they
are used to perform tasks such as handwriting recognition 
(converting human handwriting into computer text) and checking for
forged signatures.<br>
<br>
They are far simpler than real nervous systems though. A typical neural
network has a few thousand neurons. By contrast, an ant's brain 
has 250,000 nerve cells. A human brain has over 10 billion - including
dozens of different types of neuron, specialised for different tasks.<br>
<br>
Trying to get computers to imitate the human brain has led to the
growth of a new field known as cognitive science, where computers are 
used to gain insights into human behaviour. Experiments with people can
be compared against the behaviour of computer models, allowing 
theoretical ideas about the mind to be tested. This is where computer
science meets psychology.<br>
<br>
Cognitive scientist Daniel Wolpert described an interesting new
statistical model describing how our perception is filtered by what we 
expect. Known events are largely ignored, whilst unexpected things grab
our attention. One consequence of his model is that in quarrels, 
we consistently underestimate our own force (which we know about and
expect). This can easily cause arguments to escalate, with both 
parties convinced that it is the other person who is to blame for
shouting louder, or shoving harder. Wolpert demonstrated this with an 
experiment where volunteers exchanged taps, trying - and failing - to
match each other's force.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, when the experiment was repeated with schizophrenic
patients, they performed better than normal - avoiding the escalation 
of force. According to Wolpert, this is because schizophrenic patients
are somewhat disassociated from their actions, and can thus be 
more objective.<br>
<br>
Cognitive science advances hand-in-hand with AI. Wolpert's work uses
computer science to answer questions in psychology. But it can 
then influence future robot design - which will in turn enable more
experiments.<br>
<br>
The current state of the art in robot design was demonstrated by Sony's
QRIO robot. QRIO looks like a small astronaut, with large cute 
eyes. He chirps and dances very endearingly. Crucially, he can walk
better than previous robots - which he demonstrated by navigating a 
(very very simple) obstacle course.<br>
<br>
True walking remains beyond the reach of current robots though. With
two dozen motors QRIO is a complex machine - but that's nothing 
compared to the human body, which has over 600 muscles. QRIO
experiences the world through two camera eyes, microphone ears, an 
infra-red range finder and 7 touch sensors. A human also has 2 eyes and
2 ears, but millions of touch, taste and smell sensors. QRIO can 
manage less than 1 mile-per-hour over smooth ground. Humans can do 10
miles an hour over rough terrain.<br>
<br>
The biggest difference of all is in thinking: Through our flexible
understanding of the world and our ability to think creatively, we can
solve 
the complex many-faceted problems of daily life. Our brains enable us
to scale mountains, read newspapers, raise families, compose 
music, build cities, and send men to the moon. QRIO is able to
recognise faces and say "Hello".<br>
<br>
Inspite of the impressive progress reported this week, human beings
remain the only real source of intelligence.
