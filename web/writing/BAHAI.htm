The noonday sun reflects from every facet of the white structure which
dominates the landscape. The unfurled outer layers shimmer in the
heat, their wierd angles alien to the rolling lawns. The Bahai are
here with a message for the people of the Earth.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been a difficult journey though. The
Bahai Faith is a religon that was founded in 1844. A youth in Persia
had a vision following which he renamed himself the Gate and started
preaching that religon is progressive, everyone must find there own
way to the truth and all religons are equally valid. He was clearly
insane and, being completely peaceful, was of course heavily
persecuted.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The movement took hold however. Today there
are 0.7 million Bahais spread across the globe, making them the
seventh largest religon (although after the first few there's a real
big drop off). They believe in freedom, equality and compulsory
education, would abolish extremes of poverty and wealth, elect their
leaders (democratic religon?) and think all work should be exalted to
the level of worship. Rumours that most of Cambridge University is
secretly Bahai are completely unfounded however. They have completely
missed out on all the smiting-of-the-infidel bits which make other
religons such good fun.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish them luck in converting the
world. They'll need it (either that or god on their side) since
evangelising goes against Bahai principles. I myself could never join
such a bunch of bloody do-gooders. The one we met didn't even have the
saving sin of being self righteous. He was serious and softly spoken,
but with the intensity of a true believer. In spite of this,
everything he said sounded eminently reasonable, but I remain an
honest god fearing athiest (who has more reason to fear god than an
athiest?). That's alright with the Bahai; maybe it's just my way to
the truth.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various Bahai temples are all different, but all have 9 sides, their holy number. People of all religons are welcome to pray there, as long as a Bahai service isn't in progress. The Indian temple is probably the most beautiful, built in the shape of an opening Lotus flower. Petal shaped water pools keep it automatically air conditioned. The inside, all silent walls curving upwards, bare apart from a few choice Bahai quotations, is as good a place for meditation as you'll find. The noonday sun reflects from every facet of the white structure, which dominates the landscape. The unfurled outer layers shimmer in the heat, their wierd angles alien against the rolling lawns. The locals know exactly what to make of it all though: postcards.<br><br>
