PRESENTER<br>
Tonight on Newsnight, following the act of parliament passed earlier today banning the sale of curry, and curry advertising in sports and on billboards, we look into the dark underbelly of Britain's curry culture.<br>
<br>
After the Chief of Police's statement last month citing curry use as one of the main causes of rising crime rates, with balti dealers fighting for control of the trade and desperate addicts mugging innocent people, some with families, for kebab fragments, the government has come under pressure to outlaw the fiery foodstuff. A survey released last month revealed that strong curry is now the most widely used recreational drug in Britain.<br>
In his "Arresting the Inner Child" speech last week, cult prime minister Tony Blair called for stronger measures to be implemented. {slide: New Labour No Curry} His sidekick Boy Mandelson scuttled off&nbsp;&nbsp;with the speed of a career politician pandering&nbsp;&nbsp;to mass media hysteria and the new Act passed through parliament with a velocity which we model here on this chart by representing the Bill as a piece of Chicken Tikka Jalfrezi, and the House of Commons by a pissed bloke from Birmingham. {relevant slides}<br>
<br>
SCIENTIST<br>
{slide: profile diagram of human body/digestive tract}<br>
It has long been known that curry has powerful addictive qualities. The intensity of the spices hurt the stomach walls, causing the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, creating a `curry high' lasting several hours. {slide: mushroom cloud}<br>
However the come down can be terrible: indigestion, bad breath, and flatulence which can cause internal haemorrhaging and irreversible death. In the sick lingo of the curry pushers, a `good' curry is said to be hotter on the way out than on the way in. If you see someone who's taken a bad curry, the only cure is large amounts of lager followed by vigorous clubbing. {slide: an adorable baby seal}<br>
<br>
PRESENTER<br>
Today's move follows the government health warning added to all curry products 4 years ago as part of Jack Straw's controversial "No Fun For Anybody Anymore Bill". A spokesperson for Christian Parents Against Curry said it was an important victory, but expressed disappointment that the motion to make curry based substances a class B drug had been watered down to making curry a class C controlled substance (available only on prescription), and accused the government of being in the pay of the powerful but shadowy curry lobby, made up of wealthy industrialists, bloody foreigners and members of the Monkees.<br>
<br>
The following is a true account from a curry victim:<br>
{lights down on studio and up on a twitchy teenager. slide: a curry addict}<br>
ADDICT:<br>
Yeah, I first tried curry back at uni. Everyone was experimenting with it back then. Some of my friends introduced me... they told me how bad it would make me feel but not how good. I started light, y'know?, just a dahl or korma, but it builds up. Soon I was cooking up every day. I lost my job, my girlfriend... ended up on the street.<br>
Yeah, been an addict 5 years now. I'm in treatment now, they're trying to wean me onto mustard, but it's tough...I wouldn't do it again, y'know. It's not worth it...<br>
<br>
PRESENTER:<br>
Sadly, the man you just heard relapsed a few months after that recording was made, started mainlining chilli sauce and died of an overdose last night. {offstage: a mournful fart is heard in the distance, ending with a short scream. slide: Curry = Death} Just another casualty of the curry epidemic sweeping the country and making our children smell peculiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the old tale of soft drugs leading to harder substances. If you take beer, you will do vindaloo. The message is clear: just say no to curry.<br>
