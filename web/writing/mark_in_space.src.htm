Narrator: For hundreds of years mankind has wondered and dreamt about the heavens. In 1610 Galileo turned a telescope on the sky and revealed the planets. In the last century, what was once only a dream finally became possible.<br>
In 1957 the USSR amazed the world by putting a beeping metal ball into orbit. The space age had begun.<br>

Narrator: In the intense rivalry between the USA and the goddamned Ruskies, further advances soon followed. This was the heyday of NASA and the CCCP, when funding was almost unlimited. There was Laika - the first dog in space - Yuri Gagarin - the first man in space, a spate of failed Chinese panda launches<br>
Shot: Chinese Officer: Such brave animals, so sad.<br>
Narrator: and then the Apollo moon landings.<br>

At the time, the Apollo program required an immense investment - possible only, perhaps, because of the cold war. Since then the technology has come a long way. A desktop PC now has more computing power than NASA had in '69.<br>
Nasa's still the big player, but they've gone soft. We at 15 Grantchester Street are going to end American domination of space. Before the end of this century, 15 Grantchester Street, Cambridge, will put a man into space.<br>
<br>
Shot 2: 15 Grantchester Street<br>
Narrator: Merkwuerdigeliebe is confident now, but it has taken a lot of work to get this far. The 15 Grantchester Street plan involves a radical new approach to space travel.<br>
<br>
Shot 3: Dan (caption: Dr Winterstein, Rocket scientist) &amp; Mark<br>
Dan: The astronaut has undergone an intensive training program to make him fit enough to undergo this mission. He will have to withstand not only acceleration forces of upto 5G but also temperatures of -270 degrees, depressurization that can cause eyes to pop out and blood to boil in the veins - pretty gruesome, huh? - and, of course, not having any air to breathe.<br>
<br>
Narrator: Which the space capsule will protect him from?<br>
<br>
Dan: No, we don't have a space capsule. Our launch plan calls for the astronaut to climb into space himself.<br>
<br>
Narrator: You are the astronaut?<br>
<br>
Mark (caption: Mark Watkins, Astronaut): That's right<br>
Narrator: How do you feel to be actually going into space?<br>
Mark: It's an honour. This is going to be a great moment for 15 Grantchester Street.<br>
<br>
Narrator: You're not scared by the danger?<br>
<br>
Mark: Hell, life is full of danger. Did Scott think about the danger when he set off for the South Pole? Did Erikson worry before embarking on his disastrous attempt at Everest? Mankind didn't get where it is today by worrying about the danger.<br>
<br>
Narrator: Can you explain to me the re-entry procedure?<br>
<br>
Mark looks blank - turns to Dan<br>
Dan: Er, we haven't briefed the astronaut on the re-entry procedure yet.<br>
<br>
Narrator: But the take off is only a week away!<br>
<br>
Mark: Hell, mankind didn't get where it is today by worrying about re-entry procedures.<br>
<br>
Shot 3: Chris<br>
Chris: I'm afraid there's no possibility of a successful re-entry. It's a one way mission. He isn't coming back.<br>
<br>
Narrator: Does the astronaut know this?<br>
Chris shakes head sadly<br>
<br>
Shot 4: 15 Grantchester Street (caption: T-2 days)<br>
Shot 5: Mark being wheeled slowly down the corridor on a chair.<br>
Narrator: The final tests have been done and the countdown has begun. From a reclined position, Mark has been raised upright. He is now being moved on a specially designed vehicle to the launch gantry; a slow process taking 2 days.<br>
<br>
fade into Shot 6: Mark on chair under loft hatch with Ben as gantry (caption: T-5 minutes)<br>
Narrator: Mark is now in position on the launch gantry. We are just minutes away from the take off.<br>
<br>
Shot 7: Dan &amp; Chris in Mission control.<br>
Dan: This is mission control from where we'll monitor the launch. In just 4 minutes he'll start climbing. By the time he hits the attic roof, he'll be going so fast, gravity won't be able to pull him back. From there on, he'll climb through the atmosphere and on into outer space.<br>
<br>
Shot 8: Mark looking tense<br>
T-10 seconds, 9, 8,<br>

Shot 10: launch gantry<br>
3, 2, 1, 0 We have lift off.<br>
Mark gets leg up and starts to scramble up into the attic.<br>
Mark: I can't make it…<br>
<br>
Shot 11: Mission control<br>
Dan: Something's wrong<br>
Chris: Abort! Abort! Abort! Mission is red repeat mission is red.<br>
<br>
Shot 12: Mark drops down into a pile on the floor<br>
<br>
Shot 13: <br>
Dan: This is a real setback to the 15 Grantchester Street space program. We'll have to investigate what went wrong… This will set us back by 6 months at least, by which point Trinity College may have a Mark in space (head in hands)<br>
<br>
Chris: We've invested too much money and political capital in putting a man into space to fail now. The only thing to do is to cynically decieve the world by faking a successful mission.<br>
<br>
Camera truns to the door, but it is now blocked by an armed guard.<br>
 Chris (offscreen): I'm afraid we can't allow you to leave just yet<br>
<br>
 Shot 14: A forlorn shot of the empty gantry (Ben) with bleak sound of wind blowing<br>
