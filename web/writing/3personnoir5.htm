 <h2>Scene 5: You Just Can't Trust Some Criminal Lunatics</h2>
[MUSCLES and HARRY enter]
MUSCLES: Guess what Smartshit?
EDDY: If you boys are selling raffle tickets, I'm afraid the girl guides already cleaned me out.
HARRY: No, there's been another killing. And again the victim was of Jewish persuasion.
EDDY: And now it's too late to persuade him otherwise. Another note?
HARRY: Sort of. This time they wrote it on the alley wall, using the victim's own blood.
EDDY: The third letter of the name, right?
HARRY: No. It said: 'The last letter of The Name has been uttered.'
EDDY: The last?
HARRY: But this one wasn't working for me.
EDDY: Who was he?
HARRY: Some Ginsberg character. No-one I ever heard of.
EDDY: [perplexed] It's not right.
HARRY: Maybe, but it seems this concludes it. Here's your money. Less 500 for my protection of course.
EDDY: You're dropping the case? We can't quit this case. Three men are dead.
HARRY: What of it? There are many left.
EDDY: Two of your own men, and you'll let the murderers get away?
HARRY: As long as it's a religious thing, who are we to interfere? You're talking about imposing western values on another culture. 
EDDY: Jews are western Harry.
HARRY: Even so, I wouldn't want that shit on my conscience.
EDDY: Your conscience Harry? Your conscience is hiding out in a warm whorehouse someplace without an extradition treaty.
HARRY: Don't get too smart Eddy. Your protection money will only go so far. I'm a businessman, and this cabala shit ain't my business. [makes to depart] You coming Muscles?
MUSCLES: I'm going to talk a little with Smartshit here if that's OK Boss.
HARRY: Sure. [exit HARRY]
EDDY: [produces a hip flask & pours two shots] To liver failure. 
[they drink]
EDDY: Something's not right Muscles. I think there's going to be another murder.
MUSCLES: It's written here. This was the last.
EDDY: Maybe it's written different somewhere else. You can't go trusting notes written by criminals, especially insane ones. Remember, the name of god has 4 letters in Jewish tradition. And the murders were committed on the 4th, the 8th and the 12th of the month. All multiples of 4. They're symmetrical in time.
MUSCLES: So there's another one coming in four days.
EDDY: Right. Symmetrical in time... Find me a map of the city. [MUSCLES looks around blankly] In the bookshelf [EDDY gestures, MUSCLES procures a map]. The first murder took place in the Windsor Hotel. [he marks the map] The second was here. [another mark] Where was the latest murder?
MUSCLES: Corner of Lincoln and Janus.
[EDDY plots the third point]
MUSCLES: Well look at that.
EDDY: Three corners of a perfect square. Which means...
MUSCLES: The 4th murder will be here.
EDDY: Symmetrical in time and space.
MUSCLES: What are you going to do?
EDDY: [produces a gun] Get there early and bust the party. [pockets the gun again]
In the meantime... [pours another two shots]
MUSCLES: To drunkeness and beyond. [they drink] You know for a guy who collaborates with cops, you ain't too bad.
EDDY: For a brutal thug, neither are you.
