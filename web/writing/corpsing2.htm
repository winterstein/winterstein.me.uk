 <h2>Scene 2: Epilogue</h2>
[Spotlight: JOHN hangs dead; the rope creaks slightly as he swings back and forth, gently now. Broaden the light. The cat sits looking up at the corpse, meows mournfully, walks to its feeding bowl, turns and meows again.]

[Notes on this scene:
1) The audience might presume that the hanging marks the end of the play. However they will shut up when the spotlight comes on.
2) Moving the cat (which I envisage being done with strings) may make the scene ridiculous. In this case the cat should remain still, and the spotlight (after a suitable pause) be used to indicate the food-bowl.]

I used to go with the flow but times and tides have changed, and you just can't go with the ebb. We want so much from life, but there comes a point where we will settle for a dignified exit.


The means justify the end. 

[The script below contains very few directions as to pauses, tone of voice, etc. This does not of course mean that it should be played in monotone. I find it most tedious to insert such directions. Moreover it is usually clear how the text should be played, at least to the extent that such directions can help. Therefore most such directions have been omitted.]

I battle against my memories, like a man against his demons
I fall before my memories, like a man with his lover
I lie down with my memories like a bride
& am smothered by them

This is not life it is but a slow death 
there are moments of reprieve, but fewer and fewer

loneliness eats away at me until all I have left is loneliness
& I am tired of pretending otherwise

loneliness - the new leprosy
blights your life & causes healthy people to shy away from you

[to the cat] If I were you and you were me, if I were the animal, you would put me out of my misery.

the saint shits in his bed

affront to what I was

sleight of body

I believe love and joy are the only things worth living for. But there is something else.
Survival: to live even when there is nothing to live for.
But that is my DNA's agenda, not mine.


darkly funny, the way death is

saved the golden memories of me dribbling pissing myself gabbling mindlessly

Like a rotten tree, the shell supports the dead middle.
the facade remains

How could anything good come of something so broken?




Love! Love. To love is to risk losing. It is the greatest of gambles. 
Oh we were so beautiful at the beginning. I remember forgotten times. Unimportant moments when we were together. [standing] [with energy] A walk down by a creek under trees. A boy and a girl talk of idle and forgettable things. The day is sunny. He is just twenty, she seventeen. The world is opening up for both of them, and it will be sunny walks and soft kisses and hot kisses and late nights and wine and art and ideas and such beautiful glorious action and it will never end. They stop beneath a spreading tree. 
He hardly knows her yet. She is an opening mystery by his side. She moves with elegance and grace. Acts with passion. So pure and true. A perfect beauty of a girl. A sweet natural eye to the world. Woke up and alive, all excited in the great flow of life. Rejoice! For such beauty was-is real, Rejoice! He lies back, and she lies with him. Kisses his face gently. He gazes up and his world is covered in canopies of green leaves and falling brown hair.
[sits]
Oh, I was her Romeo then. Then. [pause] We were going to be married. [shrugs] Everything ends badly. None of us pass through life without leaving a trail of tears behind. Our own and others. It’s the snail slime that sticks us together. What magic was it, to turn love into despair? An everyday miracle too terrible to behold. Yes, everything ends badly. Happiness is only ever on loan, and joy is a delicate transitory thing existing only for the moment, and what is true is true only for one time and one place, and all the rest of that shit.
So here I am, by a beached boat watching a grey sea.

I walked along the shore earlier. The flotsam and jetsam of the world – everything washes up here sooner or later. Twenty yards over that way [gestures] there are hundreds of dead jellyfish. Waves and waves of them like an invasion. 
[imitates a jellyfish] Commander the troops are ready, let the invasion begin! [the jellyfish advances]
[human again] I imagine them with high hopes. They must of thought they were doing so well. Just forgot one thing. [sits down] If they can die, why not I?

There were some girls here earlier. They laughed so easily. Splashed in the surf, reminded me that the beach is not just an entrance to the ocean. I watched them from here. I looked on them as a drowning man looks at land [beat] on the horizon. I didn't say hello.

There was a time I would have. I would have laughed and splashed with them. I used to go with the flow. But time and tides change. There were malign lunar influences, and you can't go with the ebb. I have tried. I have tried not let my past failures stop me from failing again. I have tried to find another woman. I have even tried personal ads:
'Wanted: sophisticated intelligent caring senstitive beautiful woman, or nearest offer.
Sometimes there was sex, but that was no help. It was desperate sex, lonely people searching in others for an answer to their loneliness, and seeing only a mirror of it. [beat] Drowning people can't save each other.

I have tried, and tried again. But it's hard. This broken life I lead – well I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Especially since I am my own worst enemy. So I have given myself a day at the beach. I have had my final meal: chips with brown sauce - the sand got into them of course - followed by ice cream, although it's not good for my figure.

[finishes the whisky] 
Shall I leave a note? [looks at the empty bottle] A message in a bottle. What would I say? [pause] 'Please dispose of this bottle thoughtfully' No. [tosses the bottle aside] A pile of clothes is eloquent enough. No-one to write to anyway, the consequences of my life are like foam from a wave. So, goodbye to all that. All that brought me here to the sea. To sit by a beached boat slowly rotting, holes showing through her ribs. Sitting by a beached boat watching a grey sea.

I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
I do not think that they will sing to me.
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black
[rises]
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea girls wreathed with seaward red and brown
Till human voices wake us and we drown.

[steps out into the audience and slowly walks out]
I go. Perhaps I will reach America.
I go; swallowed
Like a pebble in the ocean.
Seamlessly.
[exit out the back of the auditorium]
