 <h2>Scene 6: The Office</h2>
[A conference room, Monday. SARAH is seated, JOHN enters and takes a seat.]
JOHN: Where's Benway?
[silence]
SARAH: You fucking bastard.
[JOHN is not pure pond-slime. He hadn't decided for certain on betrayal until he actually did it, and hence thinks of it as a spur of the moment slip in ethics (not his true self). He likes SARAH, and feels regret, although perhaps expresses it poorly.]
JOHN: It's a dog eat dog world.
SARAH: You cunt. You even promised: 'oh let me look; I would never steal'.
JOHN: Hey, I may have said I wouldn't steal, but I never said I wouldn't lie.
SARAH: You're fucking unbelievable. And to think I - arh!
JOHN: I'm sorry. I was in his office and it just came out. And...
SARAH: You make me sick.
JOHN: I didn't plan this. Could we try to put it behind us?
SARAH: I don't see how.
[pause. BENWAY enters]
BENWAY: Morning team.
SARAH: Mr Benway, I have a new idea.
BENWAY: Oh good; I knew we hired you for something. 
JOHN: Behave yourself Benway. I'm sorry Sarah. Please, hit us.
SARAH: Don't tempt me. [she stands and addresses BENWAY] 
BENWAY: What aspect of the campaign is it for?
SARAH: It's not - I mean, it's an idea for a wholly new campaign.
BENWAY: It's a little late in the day to start from scratch.
SARAH: Please - this is a better idea. And I've done a lot of the preparation. We could easily switch.
BENWAY: Hmm. OK, I'm listening.
SARAH: First up: the bedroom scene - it's hardly groundbreaking. The tried and tested methods, well they're tried and tested - and forgettable. But do something different and you get people's attention, you get noticed, talked about. Lots of free publicity.
BENWAY: So what have you got that's never been seen before?
SARAH: We open with a shot of some third world sweatshop. It's a grim place. We use grainy film to suggest documentary footage. Subtitles: It doesn't have to be this way.
JOHN: Is this meant to be a joke?
SARAH: Wait and learn. [back to BENWAY] It's too grim, we don't want to be there. Slide cut to a party. Still in the same part of the world, but this time it's exotic. The people aren't rich, but they look cool. They're happy, they're wearing house shoes, slipping in and out of them, dancing laughing. Subtitles:
Actual employees /  We believe in wages / that allow you to live / properly. 
BENWAY: I don't get it.
SARAH: Part of it is, the client will have to budget for paying them a decent wage. In return they can hike their prices even higher. Also we find some sexy employees and some earthy employees and turn them into our celebrities - big saving there. We're selling sex, youth, freedom, love, friendship, all that is good and slippers.
BENWAY: You're right: it is new. Well done, you've got something there. I hate to say this, but: no.
SARAH: No?
BENWAY: [shakes his head] Not a chance in hell.
SARAH: [brittle] The company's worried about it's human rights image - well this will make them heroes.
BENWAY: Yes perhaps it would. There are consumers who shop ethically and we'd get them. But they belong to the demographic group F1: freaks and wierdos.
SARAH: Why are they freaks?
BENWAY: They're freaks because there aren't enough of them. Most consumers are happy just as long as they don't have to know about the bad shit.
SARAH: Yes, but we're making this a selling point. Part of the brand image.
BENWAY: The bottom line is that the ethical market is too small. Anyway, you can get your hands on a fair amount of that market just by selling the product in mottled brown packaging with a picture of a happy foreign peasant. Shit I'm sorry girl. Don't get disheartened. It's bold and it's original. But realistically, it'd never work.
SARAH: [close to tears] So I guess we go with my first idea.
JOHN: Watch it.
BENWAY: Remember, the client is coming round tomorrow. So you two are good colleagues for the day. I mean it - best fucking behaviour or the dole queue. And no swearing. [checks watch] Get the place ready, I have shit to do. [BENWAY exits]
[SARAH is dejected at this point and just wants to make it through the day. However with Benway out of the room, she finally achieves some power. Gradually she regains a bit of strength and defiance.]
JOHN: Right. What do we need to do?
[SARAH ignores him, starts arranging chairs, papers, etc.]
JOHN: I liked your idea, just now.
[silence]
JOHN: You're looking -
[silence]
JOHN: Look er...
SARAH: I don't want to talk to you.
JOHN: We're working together.
SARAH: We don't have to talk about anything other than work.
JOHN: This is... What can I do?
SARAH: Tell Benway the truth.  
[pause. JOHN flounders]
SARAH: You meant what else could you do, apart from tell the truth?<!-- JOHN: [in a harsh whisper] Look, I need a break. You've got time; I need this. -->
[BENWAY enters]
JOHN: Right, I think we're ready. Good work Sarah.
BENWAY: [looks around critically, nods some sort of approval] Right. 
JOHN: You don't seem very excited.
BENWAY: I'll be enthusiastic when I need to be.
JOHN: This is the big pitch. Make or break.
BENWAY: Well. It's not just that this kind of campaign has been done before. It's been done before by me. Right, we're almost ready. John - hire some models for the day - beautiful, but sharp.
JOHN: Female?
BENWAY: A few of each. Remember to get an asian and a black.
SARAH: What are you hiring models for?
BENWAY: We give them clipboards and a bit of paperwork and tell them to look dynamic. It impresses the client.
SARAH: That's ridiculous.
BENWAY: Remember we are in the image business. If we can't take care of our own image, how are we going to help theirs? Oh and Sarah; wear your glasses tomorrow and show subtle cleavage.
SARAH: Subtle cleavage?
BENWAY: Yes subtle cleavage Miss Harrison. As if you are sexy, sophisticated and intelligent. I wish you to use your body and feminine wiles to help sell this company. And Miss Harrison?
SARAH: What?
BENWAY: Don't pretend you don't do that all the time anyway.
