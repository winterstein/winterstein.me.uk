 <h2>Scene 1: A hole</h2>

[Sounds of strenuous work. Lights up. UNDERDOG is digging stage right.]
UNDERDOG: [exhausted] This can't go on much longer. [keeps digging] I've been down this hole so long, I no longer remember how I got here. [pause] Digging. [pause] Too deep. I'm stuck in a hole so deep my only hope now is China. [stops digging and steps back to admire his work] Not bad. Not a bad days work, eh? [sits down]
[The pile of blankets stirs and a head emerges]
PRES: Cur! Why have you stopped working? The work isn't done.
UNDERDOG: [with despair] It will never get done.
PRES: Not at this rate. [he gets up] Look - You've only made it a few metres beyond the cupboard.
UNDERDOG: You move the cupboard! 
PRES: Nonsense. You don't work hard enough.
UNDERDOG: You move the cupboard! Whenever I get anywhere you move it.
PRES: Have you ever seen me move the cupboard?
UNDERDOG: You do it when I sleep.
PRES: Get back to work.
UNDERDOG: [taking up his spade and turning to dig] [with hope] We must be almost there, because I can't go on much longer.
PRES: [agreeing] That's logical. [pause] [mainly to himself] Yes. We've worked hard. Laboured. Harder than anyone can expect. I feel... [to UNDERDOG] Leave it alone a minute!
[UNDERDOG keeps digging]
PRES: Listen to me!
[UNDERDOG stops digging]
PRES: I have a feeling. <!-- In my bones, in my being. --> I feel certain something is going to happen today. [pause] Something momentous.
[pause]
UNDERDOG: What?
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: What will happen?
PRES: The next stage.
UNDERDOG: There is a next stage?
PRES: There must be.
UNDERDOG: That's logical. [pause] When?
PRES: Soon. Unless it is later.
[pause]
PRES: Did I ever tell you about the French Ambassador's dinner?
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: [quite the raconteur, although still speaking in slow stilted rhythms] There was a dinner given by the French Ambassador; one of those occasions. With my position, I had to go to a lot of such things of course. What can I say of them? The wine would flow like water until all the women were beautiful. But the purpose was always politics.
Now there was a woman there who stood out from the crowd: The new British Consul's wife. She was a very glamorous lady. Nature and money had conspired to make her so. Wore a full length white dress cut away at the back - tres chic, and tres becoming too; it matched her figure perfectly. Rustled ever so gently when she walked, like the wind amongst palms. And she had a fur stole draped over her [beat] exquisite shoulders.
'Is that real mink?' someone asked her.
'Yes,' she replied, 'But it's heavily sedated.'
She spoke like a chandelier. There was cut crystal in that voice; old money, manners without warmth.
Anyway, we were taking after dinner drinks in the garden. A nice garden, with a pond. Let us take - for a moment - a frogs eye view of the world. People are moving around by your pond with the the tinkling sounds of polite conversation, but this doesn't bother you, even though they've strayed unusually close to the pond. We frogs are calm characters. You have another a fly, enjoy the evening air, then - Splash! Pond water and lily pads fly everywhere!
The British Consul's wife. No longer quite so glamourous. Pond weed draped over her exquisite shoulders. 
You should have seen her face. We all laughed like hell.
UNDERDOG: You laughed?
PRES: [pause] It was different then. We had an ideology.
UNDERDOG: What was that?
PRES: A way of understanding. I forget the details. A mix of love and hate.
UNDERDOG: Surface things.
PRES: You had to be there. [pause] [imperiously] Prepare lunch.
UNDERDOG: [going to the cupboard] I don't know why I obey you. [pause] Can you explain that?
PRES: I am The President.
UNDERDOG: Yes. So you are to blame for...
PRES: Go on. Say it.
UNDERDOG: For this hole we're in.
PRES: There were factors beyond my control.
UNDERDOG: You pushed the button!
PRES: If I hadn't, someone else would have.
UNDERDOG: That is a lame excuse and you know it.
PRES: [in an annoying baby voice with ugly undertones] That is a lame excuse ner ner ner. [pause] Get our lunch.
UNDERDOG: [as he carries out the order] I could refuse. I am a free man.
PRES: [sarcastically] You are free. You are free to do as I tell you. [brief laugh; continues mainly to himself] Freedom? What freedom do any of us have? We do as our natures dictate. Nature dictates I dictate. Even if I regret... but that too is my nature driving me.
UNDERDOG: [bitter] Voila Monsieur. Tinned cabbage. [presents PRES with a dish, and sits down with his share which he eats out of the can]
PRES: Don't be difficult. There are lots of exciting things you can do with cabbage.
UNDERDOG: No doubt, but none of them involve eating the stuff. [pause] We could grow some more mushrooms.
PRES: No we can't. 
UNDERDOG: I can't see any reason why not.
PRES: It's not the right season.
UNDERDOG: There are seasons still?
PRES: Of course there are seasons. Fool! You know nothing about agriculture.
UNDERDOG: I know we're eating cold tinned cabbage again.
PRES: I told you there's a reason.
UNDERDOG: There's a reason for everything. But I'm not sure that it's a good one. [pause] What did you eat? At the dinner with the French Ambassador, what did you eat then?
PRES: [spitefully] Cabbage.
[UNDERDOG (sulking) produces a mobile phone and toys with it (e.g. making ringtone noises)]
PRES: Don't know why you keep that thing.
UNDERDOG: It's valuable. 
[pause]
When we break through, well, they probably won't have the technology anymore.
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: The technology to make these will have been lost.
PRES: Probably.
UNDERDOG: So it's irreplaceable.
PRES: It's useless.
UNDERDOG: Irreplaceable. And that is the source of value.
PRES: [pause] Give it here.
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: What?
UNDERDOG: It's mine.
PRES: I order you to give it here.
UNDERDOG: No.
PRES: What! I am your President & I order you.
UNDERDOG: This is private property. I know my rights.
[pause]
PRES: Get digging.
[UNDERDOG takes up his spade. PRES gets a cup of water and a mirror from the cupboard. He starts shaving.]
UNDERDOG: Sir?
PRES: What is it?
UNDERDOG: How many razor blades do you have?
PRES: None of your business.
UNDERDOG: Do you think perhaps I could have a new one?
PRES: No.
UNDERDOG: Perhaps for my birthday?
PRES: No. Even though it is your birthday.
