 <h2>Scene 4: Sarah's Flat</h2>
[Evening, a day or two later. SARAH and JOHN share a sofa soft slow music plays in the background. He is smooth (but overplays it a little), she is seductive.]
JOHN: Slippers. What a shitty account.
SARAH: Don't say that. I've waited so long to work on an account at this level - to be there mapping out the whole campaign, designing the strategy, seeing the big picture. [beat] I love the job. It's the only job. I even love the stress. 
JOHN: I know what you mean. It's a real high, all that adrenalin pumping round your veins.
SARAH: Yeah. Better than drugs. [beat] Shame about the product though.
JOHN: [shrugs] Thank you for cooking me dinner.
SARAH: I'm glad you liked it.
JOHN: Actually it was revolting. I only took second and third helpings to be polite.
SARAH: Would you like another drink?
JOHN: Thanks, I'd love one.
SARAH: [gets up, walks to exit, turns] Red again? 
JOHN: Sure. 
[SARAH exits. There is a muffled tinkle of broken glass]
JOHN: You OK?
SARAH: [offstage] Yes, fine - I'll just be a minute. [quietly] shit.
JOHN: Do you want a hand in there?
SARAH: [offstage] No, it's OK.
[JOHN twiddles his thumbs, gets up and looks at her bookshelf, picks up a book. SARAH reappears with two wine glasses]
SARAH: W.B.Yeats. You like him? [handing him a glass]
JOHN: [smiles] If I had the heavens embroidered cloths, I would lay them at your feet. But I am poor and have nothing but dreams; tread softly for you tread upon my dreams.
[JOHN puts the book down and takes SARAH's hand]
JOHN: Or perhaps it's that you walk in beauty, like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies, And all that's best of dark and bright / Meet in your aspect and your eyes. 
SARAH: Ah. Such lovely things. You're just saying that.
JOHN: Oh, I am only saying that to get you into bed. But I wouldn't want to get you into bed if it weren't true. 
SARAH: John: Don't mess me around.
JOHN: [pleads his innocence with body language]
SARAH: Are you serious about this - us?
JOHN: [a flicker of hesitation] Sarah, I think you're amazing; smart, bold, beautiful and -
SARAH: Shut up. 
[they kiss, and so on. There is a slightly embarrassing moment when they have to put down the wine (which he does), but it's only a moment. They smile at it, and move on. They are well on their way to having sex when SARAH starts to get up.]
JOHN: What the? Where are you going?
SARAH: I have an idea.
JOHN: What?
SARAH: For the campaign. I have an idea. I want to get it down before I forget it.
JOHN: I - We - 
SARAH: [gets up] This is important.
JOHN: I don't believe this. [he rises to join her] What's your great idea then?
[she shields her writing]
JOHN: You're not going to tell me. You're something you know. [he tries to look again]
SARAH: [with a hint of tension] No copying mind you.
JOHN: Of course not.
