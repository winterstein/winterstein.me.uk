<p>
It is  with great sadness that I write this. My brother-in-law Joe Ruddy died last Sunday. He was just 31.
Joe was a <a href=http://joeruddy.org.uk/music.php>musician</a>, <a href=http://joeruddy.org.uk/gallery.php>artist</a>, and a natural 
comic. 
Even during his illness he always kept his positive attitude and sense of humour. Most of all he was a lovely good-natured man 
and the perfect husband. 
It is a terribly cruel fate that he should die so young and just a couple of months before his wife is due to give birth. I'm 
sure he would have been a wonderful father.
