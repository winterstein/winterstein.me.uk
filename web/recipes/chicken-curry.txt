# Miscellaneous Chicken Curry   
by Daniel Winterstein

## Ingredients

All the ingredients are optional, all measurements are approximate, and many other things can be added.

 - 1 tin chick peas
 - 1 cup red lentils
 - 4 chicken breasts, cubed
 - 1 red pepper
 - 8 tomatoes, chopped
 - 2 normal onions, diced
 - 4 cloves garlic
 - 1 chilli
 - 1/2 cup of milk
 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice
 - 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
 - 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
 - 2 teaspoons turmeric
 - 4 teaspoons garam masala
 - 1 teaspoon chilli powder
 - Salt to taste (1/2 teaspoon?)
 - 1 tablespoon flour
 - 3 tablespoons oil
 
Serves 8

## Cooking

Set the lentils simmering in 3 cups of water. Skim the starchy foam off after a couple of minutes with a slotted spoon. They'll take ~30 minutes to cook. Top up with water if needed.

Chop the chicken into bite size pieces with scissors. Place the flour, turmeric, and chilli powder in a bag, add the chicken and shake to give it a light coating.
Heat two tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan. Add the chicken and fry on a high heat until browned. Set the chicken aside.

I like peppers burn-roasted so they're soft sweet and smoky. Chop the pepper into wide flat strips. Fry skin-side-down on a high heat without 
any oil -- or put them on a fork, and burn them directly in the stove flame. Let the skin properly burn until brown/black. Then remove from the heat and scrape off the burnt skin by rubbing with a knife under cold water -- it should come off easily. Chop into bite-size pieces.

Gently fry the onions and peppers in a tablespoon of oil with the turmeric and cumin. Cook until the onions go clear and soft (5 minutes?). 
Add the garlic, chilli, cumin and coriander (crush the seeds with your fingers to release the flavour) and fry for another two minutes. 
When chopping chilli, wash your hands afterwards -- it's all to easy to forget and accidentally burn your eyes or elsewhere.

Add the chicken, the lentils, and the rest of the ingredients. Stew for between 10 minutes and 2 days. Serve with basmati rice or naan.

Or if you want to keep it simple, just chop and fry the chicken, onions and pepper together with the turmeric, cumin and chilli for 10 minutes, then throw everything else in and stew for an hour. The effect is much the same.
