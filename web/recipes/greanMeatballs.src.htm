Delicious bright green meatballs! A strangely tasty North African dish.
<p>
Ingredients
<ol>
<li> Equal parts minced lamb...
<li> ...and pureed spinach
<li> an egg
<li> garlic, chopped or crushed
<li> salt, pepper, koriander, cumin &amp; a little fennel
</ol>
Get a big bowl and mix everything together. Then shape into balls and fry them. They will go browny-green on the outside, but remain bright green inside.

<h3>Sauce</h3>
I reckon you could serve these in a spicy tomato sauce, but I made a mint sauce. This keeps things good and <i>green</i>. Although perhaps you could add some blue food colouring for an even stranger looking dish:

Gently fry a finely diced onion. Use the oil from frying the meatballs so as not to waste any meat-juice goodness. Add finely chopped mint leaves, lemon juice, a pinch of sugar &amp; some water. A bit of koriander &amp; turmeric will do no harm if you have some. Put the meatballs in, cover the pan &amp; let it all simmer for a bit.
