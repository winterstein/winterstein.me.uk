<font size=4>Cooking with Emetics: 1) How to Curry your Socks &amp; Make them Taste Good</font>
<p>
<p><i>In which the rich and diverse cuisine of an entire sub-continent is explained in a single article.</i>
<p><i></i>
<p>Cooking is not learnt from cookery books. It's learnt from your mother, from burnt meals and vile mistakes. It's only after you have practised and made every mistake possible that you can learn from cookery books. Above all, good cooking is learnt from good eating, which is why you should never trust a thin chef. Of course some people never learn; most of them seem to work in canteens. Good indian cooking is no exception. It requires experience, work and taste. On the other hand, perfectly good indian cooking is really quite easy. Plus versatile and cheap.
<p>
<p>The following recipe is not a specific curry, but a whirlwind intoduction to curry cooking. With the exception of oil, onions and <i>some</i> spice, every ingredient is optional. Different combinations will create completely different dishes. The equivalent for English food would be "Roast the meat, boil the vegetables to death", and for Scottish food "Fry it - possibly in batter". There are many excellent curries that do not fit the mould below. These include dhal, which is probably the cheapest way to live after economy baked beans on economy toast, and has the added advantage of tasting nice. But that is another recipe and will be told another time.
<p>
<p><b>Chicken</b> (if desired): about 1 chicken breast per person. Fry on medium heat in a little oil. Frying the meat seperately makes it easy to tell when it's done. Cut a piece in half - if there're no pink bits left, it's cooked. Place in a bowl for later.
<p>
<p>A word on <b>oil</b>: The more oil you use, the less care is needed to prevent burning. Start with enough oil to cover the pan and add more if things begin to stick. As a rough guide, the food you get from an Indian take-away has far more oil than is necessary.
<p>
<p>Dice &amp; fry <b>onions</b> (approx. &#189; an onion per person) on a low-medium heat. Onions last forever so buy them in bulk.
<p>
<p>Have a <b>beer</b>. This more than anything will improve the taste of your cooking. Drunk enough, people will enjoy anything edible, as well as kebabs.
<p>
<p>Add sliced <b>garlic</b> to the pan - about 1 clove per person. Although fresh garlic is better, you can get jars of pre-chopped garlic if you're really lazy. Garlic also lasts forever, so buy lots.
<p>
<p>The onions should go soft &amp; the garlic golden brown. Charred black garlic does not taste as good.
<p>
<p>Through the magic of curry, pretty much anything can be combined successfully. You can use as many or as few ingredients as you like - whatever you have in the fridge that hasn't gone off.
<p>
<p>Frying vegetables: red or green <b>peppers</b>, <b>carrots</b>, <b>mushrooms</b>, and so on. Slice and fry for a few minutes.
<p>
<p><b>Spices</b> (say, 1 teaspoon per person in total):
<p>
<ul type=disc>
	<li><b>cumin</b>
	<li><b>turmeric</b>
	<li><b>ground coriander</b>
	<li><b>cardamons</b> (use in moderation)
	<li><b>garam massala</b> - the basic curry mix including cinnamon, pepper, and cumin. Use generously.
	<li><b>ginger</b> (sliced fresh ginger for the purist; ground or pre-chopped from a jar for the lazy)
	<li>&amp; of course <b>chilli</b> (more on that later)
</ul>

<p>You can also use pre-mixed stuff such as 'madras spices' or 'curry powder', but these are less versatile and no easier; adopt a snobbish attitude towards those who use them. The spices you use and their proportions produce huge varieties of flavours. A good Indian cook will use spices like an artist, subtly combining and mixing them to create the desired effect. Fortunately most mixtures will give a nice dish, so don't worry. Bung it all in - tasting as you go - and whatever comes out will be good (as the actress said to the bishop). For simplicity add all the spices now and fry for a couple of minutes. 
<p>

<p>Chilli plays four important roles in Indian food:
<ol>
<li> to hide bad cooking
<li> to prove your masculinity
<li> to liven up the dish with some HEAT
<li> for it's own flavour
</ol>
Add the chilli towards the end. Use chilli sauce or a mild chilli powder and add a little at a time, tasting to get it right. You can always add more; you can't remove it. If you do overdo it, yoghurt will defuse even the most lethal curry whithout harming the taste. Call it lassi and pretend you planned it.
<p>
<p>So far you won't have much sauce. Use <b>chopped tomatoes</b> or tomato puree with some water and <b>milk</b> or <b>single cream</b> (a couple of tablespoons) to create more of a sauce.
<p>
<p>Boiling vegetables:
<p><b>Cauliflower</b> 	} - add &#189; cup of water to the pan &amp; cook 
<p><b>Peas</b>		}
<p><b>Potatoes</b> - work very nicely. The easiest way is to chop and boil them seperately, then drain and add to the pan.
<p><b>Chick peas</b> - boil seperately for 5 minutes, drain and add.
<p>
<p>Serve with <b>rice </b>(1/2 a mug or 2 handfulls per person), <b>naan</b> or both. Rice should preferably be basmati - boil for 10-12 minutes with a pinch of salt and a dash of oil on the surface. Naan is OK out of the packet, but they taste so much better if you put a little butter on - optionally with some crushed garlic mixed in - sprinkle with water and coriander leaves and heat in the oven for 5 minutes. Pitta bread can be used as a cheaper - though not as good - alternative.
<p>Garnish with more beer.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, the Kalpna restaurant on Clerk Street do an excellent all-you-can-eat lunch time buffet for &#163;5.
