Short cartoon spot along the 'Why Don't You?' ideology of encouraging kids to make and do things.

humanoid characters, not neccessarily monkeys - one could cast martians for example - but for now let's say they're monkeys.

Jenny - a playful impulsive character, perhaps a young orang-utang.

Alan - although also young, he is a sober and knowledgeable monkey. The part would be ideal for a gibbon.

In my mind I see this drawn in the style of Dr Seuss

JENNY: Monkey bored.
ALAN: Yeah.
JENNY: 


ALAN: What do we have to play with?
[they look around. the room is bare apart from lots of bananas: bananas in piles, bananas hanging on the wall, bananas propping up a table leg and so on and so forth. Alan opens cupboard and more bananas pile out.]
ALAN: Hmm... [produces a book entitled '101 Things to do with a Banana' (rated 18) and leafs through it] Let's make banana bread.


	1 and 3/4 cups of flour 

	2 teaspoons baking powder

	half a teaspoon of salt

	2/3 of a cup of sugar

	80 grams of butter - about a third of a bar

	2 eggs

	2 mashed ripe bananas

[JENNY holds up a pair of very ripe bananas]
ALAN: The riper the better for this recipe

	and half a cup of chopped walnuts



	Preheat the oven to 350F/175c/gas mark 4-5

	Grease an 8x4" loaf tin


In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking
soda, salt, and sugar. 
[ As these are mentioned, picks them up and using a different limb each time to simultaneously sift the ingredients into the bowl
by the end she is using arms, legs & (prehensile) tail, whilst balancing on her head ]

you can also add cinnamon, nutmeg or some dried coconut if you like.


add the eggs, 
[throws in two whole eggs ]
without the shells [catches eggs on their way in, opens with a can-opener and pours in]

nuts, and mashed banana. 

melt the butter and add that too

Beat until well blended.


Pour batter into prepared pan and 


	bake for about 1 hour


JENNY: You could use this time to put off doing the washing up. [vanishes]
[ALAN sighs]



ALAN: [washing] Did you know that bananas are a good source of energy? 
[JENNY, who is swinging from the light fitting behind him ignores this attempt at eductaion]
Because they contain lots of carbohydrates, they give you energy all day. 
[]

[holds up sparkling clean plate. JENNY can be seen in the reflection holding a banana as if it were a gun and pointing it at ALAN. Quick as a flash, ?? produces his?? own banana whirls and squeezes it. The banana shoots cleany out of it's skin and flies across the room, nailing ?? in the mouth.
?? looks shocked, then swallows happily]

ALAN: This is unlike sugary foods which briefly give you too much energy, then leave you feeling lousy.


ALAN: Remember to keep an eye on the time.
[A cuckoo pops out of JENNY's wrist watch making alarm noises]
JENNY: It's time. [opens the oven]
ALAN: Be careful! It'll be very hot.
[JENNY produces a jointed contraption for picking things up at long distance, which moreover has oven gloves on its grippers (keep thinking Dr Seuss), and uses this to remove the tin from the oven.]
ALAN: You'll know it's done when a skewer inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
