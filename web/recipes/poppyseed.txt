# Poppyseed Cake

This is my mother's recipe.

## Pastry
8oz self raising flour   
5oz butter or hard margerine   
4oz soft brown sugar   
2oz ground almonds   
1 egg, beaten   

Rub together / magimix flour, sugar and butter into 'breadcrumbs'. Add ground almonds then egg + little cold water if necessary. 
Make a pastry ball and chill in the fridge for 1/2 an hour.

## Filling
2 cups ground poppyseed   
2/3 cup sugar   
a squeeze of lemon juice   
a dash of milk   

Cook gently together on the hob for a few minutes, then leave to cool.

## Cake
Use a 7" x 11" tin lined with parchment paper.
Layer pastry / filling / pastry. 
The pastry is very sticky and a bit of a pain. It is easier to roll 4 smaller pieces then join them up in the tin.
Sprinkle brown sugar and sliced almonds on top, pushing them in slightly so they'll stay on afterwards.
Cook at 160 degrees for 35 minutes until golden.
