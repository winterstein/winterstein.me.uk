          # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted
to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but
changing it is not allowed.
## Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors
commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply
it to
your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know
you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to
ask you
to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software,
or
if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such
a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms
so they
know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author&apos;s
protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands
that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software
is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
to know
that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos;
reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made
it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not
licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.
## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;,
below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the
Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they
are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of
having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
of
this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for
the
physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a)
You
must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You
must
cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally
reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your
work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work
as a
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of
this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right
to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
on
the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
not
bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for
software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or, c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means
the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
For
an executable work, complete source code means all the source
code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or
object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the
object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section
is
held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
as
a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not
the
purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended
to
make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the
rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version
is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
### NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

          # GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted
to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but
changing it is not allowed.
## Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors
commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply
it to
your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know
you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to
ask you
to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software,
or
if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such
a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms
so they
know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author&apos;s
protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands
that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software
is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
to know
that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos;
reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made
it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not
licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.
## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;,
below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the
Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they
are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of
having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
of
this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for
the
physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a)
You
must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You
must
cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally
reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your
work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work
as a
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of
this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right
to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
on
the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
not
bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for
software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or, c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means
the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
For
an executable work, complete source code means all the source
code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or
object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the
object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section
is
held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
as
a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not
the
purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended
to
make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the
rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version
is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
### NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted
to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but
changing it is not allowed.
## Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors
commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply
it to
your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know
you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to
ask you
to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software,
or
if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such
a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms
so they
know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author&apos;s
protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands
that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software
is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
to know
that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos;
reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made
it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not
licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.
## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;,
below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the
Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they
are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of
having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
of
this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for
the
physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a)
You
must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You
must
cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally
reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your
work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work
as a
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of
this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right
to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
on
the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
not
bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for
software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or, c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means
the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
For
an executable work, complete source code means all the source
code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or
object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the
object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section
is
held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
as
a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not
the
purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended
to
make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the
rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version
is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
### NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;,
below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based
on the
Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they
are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of
having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
of
this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for
the
physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a)
You
must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You
must
cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally
reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way,
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
to
view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your
work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work
as a
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of
this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right
to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based
on
the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
not
bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for
software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer,
valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or, c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means
the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
For
an executable work, complete source code means all the source
code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or
object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the
object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from
the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way
you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section
is
held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
as
a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not
the
purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended
to
make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the
rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only
in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version
is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
### NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
