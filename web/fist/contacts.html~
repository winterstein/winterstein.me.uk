<br><br>All men are equal but some are more equal than others, at least as far as this website goes. Revolution only comes about through struggle and sacrifice. Listed below are those who laid down their degrees/careers to bring you The Leader's message. One day, when the people of the world have been liberated from oppression and tyranny, huge social-realist statues will be erected in their honour. Or would be, if they weren't so butt-ugly.<br>

Morning Fist is the work (in order of flatulence) of:<br>
Chris Beauchamp<br>
Peter Green<br>

with additional article(s) by<br>

Perhaps they'll get statues with paper bags on their heads.<br>
<br>
The editors would like to make it clear that they do not have anything against the Finns. Finland was chosen as the official enemy of the revolution mainly because we don't know any Finns (but if we were to meet some, we're sure we'd find them perfectly decent people).
No, the people we hate are the Flemish, but we daren't say that for fear of their terrible reprisals.<br>

Sadly animals were butchered in vast numbers whilst making this website (You should have seen their faces, the Leader mourned, I laughed & laughed.). However it was only tested on reactionaries and no african tribes were exploited in writing it. Your statutory rights to the funk are not affected.
