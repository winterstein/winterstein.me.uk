<h2>MORNING FIST MERCHANDISE</h2>
</center>
The Leader announced a new range of Fist products (available from all good shops) aimed at subverting capitalism from within and breaking into the lucrative brand name market. The initial response has been enthusiastic, with fashion gurus and loyal fans of the Revolution&#174;&copy;&#153; all showing strong support for the new range. In a nationwide ad campaign The Leader said "Send your non-revolutionary clothes where they belong - to the dustbin of fashion." The ad concludes with the remarkable offer of buying Fist products on credit under 'The 5 Year Plan'.
<br><br>
"With other brands, I was worried about being a cog in the capitalist machine, mindlessly supporting the consumer economy." said one shopper, "Now I can support the cause and look good at the same time."<br><br>

Bands of fist paramilitary stylists have seized control of the sources of shopping (ie. a mall near you) in what industry experts are calling 'a revolution in retailing, literally'.<br><br>

The clothes range ties in with a wide ranging move by the Revolution&#174;&copy;&#153; into the commercial sector. A spokesman said "The Party will stop at nothing in its efforts to line its pockets on behalf of you, the people. And everyone has a share, to be held in trust by The Leader until the withering away of the people is complete and only the state remains. The closer we get to victory, the more the offers just keep on coming!"<br><br>

The Revolution&#174;&copy;&#153; has diversified its investments in order to create a stable yet well performing portfolio for its shareholder comrades. The Organs of Revolutionary Advertising have been deregulated, allowing them to take on the commercial sector as the 'First Against The Wall Poster Company', and the newly opened chain of Hard Justice cafes is at the vanguard of fast food with its innovative menu of: 'Meat on a stick in a bun with a side order of JUSTICE'.
