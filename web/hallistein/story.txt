## The Hallistein Story

Our founder, Dzoe Hallistein, was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served
as a paramedic. He frequently had to rescue injured men from minefields, at
great personal risk to himself. A natural tinkerer and mechanical genius, he
vowed on his return to create autonomous mobile systems that could perform this
task without exposing humans to greater risk.

Initial success was slow to come, but by the time of his mysterious
disappearance in 1990 he had gathered around him a world-class team of experts
and the contracts, initially focussed on rescue and humanitarian work, were
starting to come in. His loss was a terrible blow to the company, but his
deputy (who is still in place today as our CEO) vowed to continue with his
legacy. The company, now repositioned to appeal to the military and security
sectors, went from strength to strength, with each new generation of Hallistein
technology winning plaudits from satisfied customers all over the world.
