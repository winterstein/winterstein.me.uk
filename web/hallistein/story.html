    >The Hallistein Story</h2
    ><p
    >Our founder, Dzoe Hallistein, was drafted into the Vietnam War, where he served as a paramedic. He frequently had to rescue injured men from minefields, at great personal risk to himself. A natural tinkerer and mechanical genius, he vowed on his return to create autonomous mobile systems that could perform this task without exposing humans to greater risk.</p
    ><p
    >Initial success was slow to come, but by the time of his mysterious disappearance in 1990 he had gathered around him a world-class team of experts and the contracts, initially focussed on rescue and humanitarian work, were starting to come in. His loss was a terrible blow to the company, but his deputy (who is still in place today as our CEO) vowed to continue with his legacy. The company, now repositioned to appeal to the military and security sectors, went from strength to strength, with each new generation of Hallistein technology winning plaudits from satisfied customers all over the world.</p
