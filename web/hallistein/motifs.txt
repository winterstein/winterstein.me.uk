# Game motifs

"Find the others"
"Learn the sequence"
"Complete the set"
"Assemble the X"

Activate cells
Narrative should have placeholders for active players
Give hardcore something to do that doesn't involve harassing other players

Pass the marble game
The longer it stays in play the more it's worth BUT the greater the chance it'll be intercepted by The Enemy
Dynamic of cutting your losses
