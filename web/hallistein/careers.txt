## Careers

Hallistein is currently recruiting in the following roles:

### Researcher

The successful applicant will have demonstrated research experience in either
robotics, AI, sensor or weapons technology.

### Security advisor

Experience with the current generation of AMPs, preferably in as tactical a
situation as possible, a significant plus.

### Marketer

Need contacts. Dodgy contacts. Contacts with dark glasses and bulletproof
Toyota Land Cruisers. We don't care which side of the law they're on, but
obviously we can't come right out and say so.

In all cases, possession of a valid US or UK security clearance is an advantage:
applicants will at least need to be eligible for such a clearance to be
considered.
