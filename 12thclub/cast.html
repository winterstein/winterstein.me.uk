<h2>Leads</h2>

<p>Charlotte  Soprano &amp; Contralto </p>

<p>Young, boyish and energetic, she loves her brother Charlie and has a soft spot for Douglas. She wants to make it big in entertainment. </p>

<p>Charlie  Tenor </p>

<p>Strong, chiselled and dependable, he fell for Katherine when she visited his hometown. He wants to make it big so he can see her again and make a good life for his sister Charlotte. </p>

<p>Douglas  Baritone/Bass </p>

<p>Buccaneering, sly and athletic, he still loves Katherine but is intrigued by Charlotte (who he thinks is a boy). He’s a Hollywood actor known for his womanising and adventures. </p>

<p>Katherine  Mezzo-Soprano </p>

<p>Sombre, catty and depressed, she hasn’t been in a film in years and she never wants to see Douglas again. But things start to change when she spots a talented new singer. </p>

<p>Andrew  Baritone/Bass</p>

<p>Floppy, steely and devious, he wants Katherine any way he can. A clear theatrical he will deal with any one who comes in the way.  </p>

<p>Toby  Baritone/Bass </p>

<p>Aggressive, grouchy and drunken, he just wants another drink and has done for thirty odd years. Every so often he remembers he loves Jacques, but only every so often. </p>

<p>Jacques  Baritone &amp; Bass </p>

<p>Amused, hurt and wary, he is an old school entertainer still in love with Toby for his sins. All he wants is the old days to return, but he knows they may never come.
Supporting Leads</p>

<p>Marlene  Contralto </p>

<p>Flirty, flinty and feisty, she’s always trying to keep Doug on the straight and narrow. Though she’d prefer to lose a month or two with the right little lady. </p>

<p>Audrey  Contralto </p>

<p>Homely, biddable and safe, she is trying to keep Katherine from getting too depressed. But has caught the eye of Marlene. </p>

<p>Tony  Baritone/Bass </p>

<p>Arrogant, selfish and anxious, he’s lost too much money again and he wants his brother’s help. Question is how does he get to Dougie? </p>

<p>Fabian  Baritone/Bass </p>

<p>Quiet, unassuming and cunning, he needs the next story, he always wants the next story. And tonight’s the night. </p>

<p>J Edgar  Baritone </p>

<p>Stuck-up, pompous and confident, he has managed Katherine’s life for a long time and no one is going to stop him. Until he realises, wrongly, that Katherine might love him.
