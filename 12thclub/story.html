<p>They finish their song in joy at the rapturous applause and distress as a fight erupts between two old enemies, Douglas, a big Hollywood actor and Toby, an English Broadway star. Luckily Toby's lover Jacques is on hand to stop them with a song. Everybody is here to have some fun tonight. But some aren't happy about it. Katherine, Douglas's ex-girlfriend and Toby's niece, is one of them. She's still upset by the death of her brother and the betrayal of her ex-lover.</p>
