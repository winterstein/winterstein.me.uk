<h2>David Townhill, composer</h2>

<p>David grew up in a musical family and studied piano and violin/viola. His technical skill on the piano was evident from an early age after winning prizes in the Edinburgh Competition Festival and later in the National Chamber Music competition. He also studied music at school and developed an interest in composing. While studying Classics at St John's College, Cambridge, he took up bass guitar to play in a rock band who recorded many original songs and played gigs around the UK. The band split up in 2006.  </p>

<p>Since then he has been working with a team of writers on the music for a new work at The Old Vic Theatre in London based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. He has also written his first musical, "The Twelfth Club", with lyricist and playwright Ken Nicholson.  </p>

<p>Most recently he has arranged and recorded a new Scottish song called "Scotland Reborn" by Hilda Petrie-Coutts. David is currently studying composing with the Open University.  </p>

<h2>Ken Nicholson, lyricist and playwright</h2>

<p>Ken has been a writer since an early age, often inventing stories throughout a creative childhood. He expanded his interest in performance whilst at Durham University and helped produce and direct various radio, theatre and film projects. His university years culminated in three productions at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, two of which were his plays Undone and Circle.</p>

<p>After leaving university, Ken worked with the Traverse Theatre in their young writers programme. He continued to produce and direct plays, most recently a production of Harvey Fierstein's Torch Song Trilogy. He met David Townhill during a production of Harold Pinter's play The Birthday Party.
